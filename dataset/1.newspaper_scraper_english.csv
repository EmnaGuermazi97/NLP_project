The Weekly Epidemiological Record (WER) serves as an essential instrument for the rapid and accurate dissemination of epidemiological information on cases and outbreaks of diseases under the International Health Regulations and on other communicable diseases of public health importance, including emerging or re-emerging infections.

Note to the readers



The World Health Organization has recently started the migration of all its Web pages towards a new content management system in order to navigate in a smoother and more efficient manner.

The task is however complex, and we are expecting a few more weeks before the full migration of both the website and the archives of the Weekly Epidemiological Record (WER) is completed.

We apologize for the inconvenience and the disruption you may encounter. In the meantime, should you need to access specific issues of past WERs please contact us by email ( [email protected] ) and we will be happy to share the relevant PDF files.

An e-mail subscription service exists, which every week provides by electronic mail the table of contents of the WER, together with other short epidemiological bulletins. To subscribe, send a message to [email protected] . The subject field should be left blank and the body of the message should contain only the words: subscribe wer-reh. A request for confirmation will be sent in reply.

Many thanks in advance for your understanding and patience.

28,"The world is in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic. As WHO and partners work together on the response -- tracking the pandemic, advising on critical interventions, distributing vital medical supplies to those in need--- they are racing to develop and deploy safe and effective vaccines.

Vaccines save millions of lives each year. Vaccines work by training and preparing the body’s natural defences --- the immune system--- to recognize and fight off the viruses and bacteria they target. If the body is exposed to those disease-causing germs later, the body is immediately ready to destroy them, preventing illness.

There are currently more than 50 COVID-19 vaccine candidates in trials. WHO is working in collaboration with scientists, business, and global health organizations through the ACT Accelerator to speed up the pandemic response. When a safe and effective vaccine is found, COVAX (led by WHO, GAVI and CEPI) will facilitate the equitable access and distribution of these vaccines to protect people in all countries. People most at risk will be prioritized. While we work towards rolling out a safe and effective vaccine fairly, we must continue the essential public health actions to suppress transmission and reduce mortality.",https://www.who.int

30,"COVAX now has agreements in place to access nearly two billion doses of several promising vaccine candidates, and laid the groundwork for further doses to be secured through contributions from donors



These agreements mean that all COVAX’s 190 participating and eligible economies will be able to access doses to protect vulnerable groups in the first half of 2021. At least 1.3 billion donor-funded doses will be made available to 92 economies eligible for the Gavi COVAX AMC, targeting up to 20% population coverage by the end of the year.



Funding raised in 2020 and early pledges toward 2021 targets, alongside these agreements, offer clearest pathway yet to ending the acute phase of the pandemic globally by the end of 2021

Geneva/Oslo, 18 December 2020 – COVAX, the global initiative to ensure rapid and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for all countries, regardless of income level, today announced that it had arrangements in place to access nearly two billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine candidates, on behalf of 190 participating economies. For the vast majority of these deals, COVAX has guaranteed access to a portion of the first wave of production, followed by volume scales as further supply becomes available. The arrangements announced today will enable all participating economies to have access to doses in the first half of 2021, with first deliveries anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2021 – contingent upon regulatory approvals and countries’ readiness for delivery.

Given these are arrangements for 2 billion doses of vaccine candidates which are still under development, COVAX will continue developing its portfolio: this will be critical to achieve its goal of securing access to 2 billion doses of safe and effective, approved vaccines that are suitable for all participants’ contexts, and available by the end of 2021. However, today’s announcements offer the clearest pathway yet to end the acute phase of the pandemic by protecting the most vulnerable populations around the world. This includes delivering at least 1.3 billion donor-funded doses of approved vaccines in 2021 to the 92 low- and middle-income economies eligible for the COVAX AMC.

The new deals announced today include the signing of an advance purchase agreement with AstraZeneca for 170 million doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford candidate, and a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Johnson & Johnson for 500 million doses of the Janssen candidate, which is currently being investigated as a single dose vaccine.. These deals are in addition to existing agreements COVAX has with the Serum Institute of India (SII) for 200 million doses – with options for up to 900 million doses more – of either the AstraZeneca/Oxford or Novavax candidates, as well as a statement of intent for 200 million doses of the Sanofi/GSK vaccine candidate.

In addition to this, COVAX also has – through R&D partnership agreements – first right of refusal in 2021 to access potentially more than one billion doses (based on current estimates from the manufacturing processes under development) that will be produced, subject to technical success and regulatory approval, by candidates in the COVAX R&D Portfolio.

“This commitment is evidence that the world learned an important lesson from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Our research and development efforts have begun to pay off. We now have safe and effective vaccines that can protect against COVID-19 and a clear pathway to securing 2 billion doses for the populations at greatest risk all around the world,” said Dr Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). “Securing the right of first refusal of successful vaccine production as part of R&D arrangements has helped guarantee equitable access to vaccines, a founding principle of CEPI. The challenge of delivering the vaccines that have demonstrated success, of completing the development of other promising vaccine candidates to further increase supply, and of ending the acute phase of the pandemic, lies ahead of us.”

Alongside boosting its pathway to two billion doses of approved vaccines through direct agreements with manufacturers, the COVAX Facility has also opened another potential source of vaccines. Published today, the Principles for Dose-Sharing provide a framework for higher-income economies to make additional volumes secured via bilateral deals available through the Facility primarily to AMC participants, on an equitable basis. These principles outline that such doses must be safe and effective, available as early as possible and should be available in substantive volumes as early as possible in 2021 to enable rapid and flexible deployment by the Facility – supporting the overall goal of equitable access.

First deliveries in Q1 2021

Today’s announcements on deals and dose-sharing mean COVAX can plan for the first deliveries of vaccines in the first quarter of 2021, with the first tranche of doses – enough to protect health and social care workers – delivered in the first half of 2021 to all participating economies who have requested doses in this timeframe. This would be followed by further delivery of doses to all participants in the second half of the year – targeting supply of doses equalling up to 20% of participants’ populations (or a lower amount if requested by the participant) by the end of the year. Additional doses to reach higher coverage levels will then be available in 2022. All deliveries are contingent upon several factors, such as regulatory approvals and country readiness.

“The arrival of vaccines is giving all of us a glimpse of the light at the end of the tunnel,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO). “But we will only truly end the pandemic if we end it everywhere at the same time, which means it’s essential to vaccinate some people in all countries, rather than all people in some countries. And we must remember that vaccines will complement, but not replace, the many other tools we have in our toolbox to stop transmission and save lives. We must continue to use all of them.""

The COVAX Facility currently has 190 participating economies. This includes 98 higher-income economies and 92 low- and middle-income economies eligible to have their participation in the Facility supported via the financing mechanism known as the Gavi COVAX AMC. Of the 92 economies eligible to be supported by the COVAX AMC, 86 have now submitted detailed vaccine requests, offering the clearest picture yet on actual global demand for COVID-19 vaccines.

In addition to gathering detailed information on participating economies’ vaccine requests, COVAX, through Gavi, UNICEF, WHO, the World Bank, and other partners has been working closely with all countries in the Facility, particularly AMC-eligible participants, to help plan and prepare for the widespread roll out of vaccines. Conditions that determine country readiness include regulatory preparedness as well as the availability of infrastructure, appropriate legal frameworks, training, and capacity, among other factors.

“Securing access to doses of a new vaccine for both higher-income and lower-income countries, at roughly the same time and during a pandemic, is a feat the world has never achieved before – let alone at such unprecedented speed and scale,” said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which leads on procurement and delivery for COVAX. “COVAX has now built a platform that offers the world the prospect, for the first time, of being able to defeat the pandemic on a global basis, but the work is not done: it’s critical that both governments and industry continue to support our efforts to achieve this goal”.

Early pledges towards 2021 fundraising targets

To achieve this ambitious goal, COVAX currently estimates it needs to raise an additional US$ 6.8 billion in 2021 – US$ 800 million for research and development, at least US$ 4.6 billion for the COVAX AMC and US$ 1.4 billion for delivery support.

Support for the COVAX AMC will be critical to ensuring ability to pay is not a barrier to access. Thanks to the generous support of sovereign, private sector, and philanthropic donors, the AMC has met its urgent 2020 fundraising target of US$ 2 billion, but at least US$ 4.6 billion more is needed in 2021 to procure doses of successful candidates as they come through the portfolio.

The last two weeks have seen a number of pledges made to Gavi for the COVAX AMC, bringing the overall amount raised to US$ 2.4 billion:



Norway has signed a new commitment of NOK 1 billion to the International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm), to be paid from 2021 to 2030. This funding will support the Gavi COVAX AMC and comes on top of earlier commitments of NOK 164.1 million in direct funding and $6.25 million in funding transferred from the PCV AMC to support the Gavi COVAX AMC.

This funding will support the Gavi COVAX AMC and comes on top of earlier commitments of NOK 164.1 million in direct funding and $6.25 million in funding transferred from the PCV AMC to support the Gavi COVAX AMC. Canada pledged CAD 75 million in funding to support the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines in lower income economies as part of the Gavi COVAX AMC. This includes a CAD 5 million investment in the development of a mechanism to equitably reallocate vaccine doses through the COVAX Facility, either by donation or exchange.

The goal of COVAX is to deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines that have passed regulatory approval and/or WHO prequalification by the end of 2021. These vaccines will be offered equally to all participating countries, proportional to their populations, initially prioritising healthcare workers then expanding to cover vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. Further doses will then be made available based on country need, vulnerability and COVID-19 threat. The COVAX Facility will also maintain a buffer of doses for emergency and humanitarian use.

Quotes from partners

Karina Gould, Minister of International Development, Government of Canada said: “We know that as long as one country is at risk, we are all at risk. The COVAX Facility is the key to ending this pandemic and will only work if we all come together. Now is the time to make our commitment to equitable access a reality, so that everyone, everywhere has access to a life-saving vaccine.”

Dr Kwaku Agyeman Manu, Minister of Health for Ghana said: The nearly 2 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses announced today by COVAX is a welcome first step, but our journey is not yet over. As we’ve learned with routine immunisation vaccines don’t save lives, vaccination does. This means we need the health infrastructure in place - from supply chain and logistics to well- trained health workers - to ensure the effective and streamlined distribution of vaccines. For this we call on governments, manufacturers and the private sector to make urgent and necessary investments in COVAX so that no one is left behind; because ultimately no one is safe until everyone is safe.

Dag-Inge Ulstein, Norway’s Minister of International Development and Co-chair of the ACT-A Facilitation Council, said: “The good news is that many countries, foundations and some private companies have already provided support to this important collective effort. The bad news is that more is needed. We need to look beyond the health sector and the international development sector if we are to find the political and financial resources required to combat the pandemic and its many different impacts.”

Wendy Morton, Minister for Global Health at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office of the UK, which also hosted the Global Vaccine Summit in June, said: “The UK has played the leading role in championing global access to coronavirus vaccines, including by being the largest donor to the COVAX Advance Market Commitment. No one is safe until we are all safe. Along with our international partners, the UK is working hard to ensure vaccines get to everyone who needs them.”

Dr John Nkengasong, Director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) said: “Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Africa CDC has established several trusted partnerships across the globe. The COVAX partnership is one of such very critical alliances that will allow Africa to secure early access to COVID-19 vaccine needed to start vaccinating our populations across the continent.”

Henrietta Fore, Executive Director of UNICEF said: “This is an unprecedented undertaking — addressing a global pandemic while ensuring we do not leave the world’s poorest behind. UNICEF is bringing the full weight of our experience as the world’s largest single procurer of vaccines to help secure and deliver COVID-19 vaccines, and help countries prepare to receive and administer them.”

Dr Ngozi-Okonjo Iweala, co-chair of the COVAX Coordination Meeting and Gavi Board Chair said: “Nine months ago, it was hard to imagine that we would have more than one promising vaccine candidate and be in a position to make them available to both high-income countries and lower-income countries simultaneously. The global community has rallied, and we now have a platform, COVAX, that will do this. It’s time to stop questioning it and give it the support it needs to bring the pandemic to an end as swiftly as possible.”

Jane Halton, co-chair of the COVAX Coordination Meeting and Chair of CEPI said: “Science will give us the tools to fight this pandemic, but equitable access will allow us to beat it. Today marks a significant moment towards our goal of fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for those most at risk around the world. We now have a clear pathway to our goal of delivering 2 billion doses of vaccine in 2021 - enabled by COVAX R&D investments and deals with manufacturers - which can bring an end to the acute phase of the pandemic globally. In addition, governments can now demonstrate their continued commitment to this goal by contributing doses to COVAX of vaccines secured through bilateral deals. Equitable access to vaccines is in all of our interests, and we’re now a significant step closer to making this a reality.”

Mesfin Teklu Tessema, civil society representative of the COVAX Coordination Meeting and Senior Director, Head of Health Unit, International Rescue Committee said: ""The COVAX Facility is our best hope to ending this pandemic as quickly as possible with equity as its grounding force. This announcement today is an important milestone and proof that doses are forthcoming to those most in need everywhere.""

Adar Poonawalla, CEO of the Serum Institute of India (SII) said: ""We are delighted to announce that we have signed for a 100mn doses of Novavax and another 100mn doses of AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccines with COVAX, with an option of extending it by 900mn doses. The advance purchase commitments under COVAX initiative is encouraging as it will further bolster our fight and ensure equitable access at the most affordable price from Serum Institute of India.”

Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, AstraZeneca, said: “Today’s Agreement is a significant milestone for global access to the AZD1222 vaccine. Our collaboration with COVAX is testament to AstraZeneca’s commitment to broad, equitable access at no profit during the pandemic period. We now look forward to progressing our work with COVAX partners to ensure that as many people as possible around the world can access a safe, effective vaccine – wherever they live.”

Paul Stoffels, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson said: “Since we initiated development of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, Johnson & Johnson has remained committed to ensuring access to vaccines on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use. Equitable global access, inclusive of lower income countries, is critical to helping end the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Thomas B. Cueni, Director General, International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (IFPMA) said: The reason why we can mark today as a milestone for COVAX securing 2 billion doses of promising vaccines is because the vaccine makers have pulled out all the stops and have delivered beyond all expectations. So let’s indeed mark this important milestone in ensuring fair and equitable access to vaccines which we have committed to from the outset of the pandemic. But let us also remember, that we would not be where we are if science and the innovation ecosystem that allows the biopharmaceutical to develop and manufacture life saving treatments had not risen to the challenge, so that there are different types of vaccines that will be manufactured in historic quantities. Looking to 2021, it is essential that all COVAX partners and governments focus on getting things done and secure the funds need.

Notes to editors

The full list of deals that have so far been secured by COVAX on behalf of the Facility is as follows:

170 million doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford candidate, via an advance purchase agreement between Gavi and AstraZeneca, and enabled by a partnership agreement with CEPI to fund scale-out of manufacturing

About COVAX

COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by CEPI, Gavi and WHO – working in partnership with developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers, UNICEF, the World Bank, and others. It is the only global initiative that is working with governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries.

CEPI is leading on the COVAX vaccine research and development portfolio, investing in R&D across a variety of promising candidates, with the goal to support development of three safe and effective vaccines which can be made available to countries participating in the COVAX Facility. As part of this work, CEPI has secured first right of refusal to potentially over one billion doses for the COVAX Facility to a number of candidates, and made strategic investments in vaccine manufacturing, which includes reserving capacity to manufacture doses of COVAX vaccines at a network of facilities, and securing glass vials to hold 2 billion doses of vaccine. CEPI is also investing in the ‘next generation’ of vaccine candidates, which will give the world additional options to control COVID-19 in the future.

Gavi is leading on procurement and delivery for COVAX, coordinating the design and implementation of the COVAX Facility and the COVAX AMC and working with Alliance partners UNICEF and WHO, along with governments, on country readiness and delivery. The COVAX Facility is the global pooled procurement mechanism for COVID-19 vaccines through which COVAX will ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines for all 190 participating economies, using an allocation framework formulated by WHO. The COVAX Facility will do this by pooling buying power from participating economies and providing volume guarantees across a range of promising vaccine candidates. The Gavi COVAX AMC is the financing mechanism that will support the participation of 92 low- and middle-income countries in the Facility, enabling access to donor-funded doses of safe and effective vaccines. UNICEF and the Pan-American Health Organisation (PAHO) will be acting as procurement coordinators for the COVAX Facility, helping deliver vaccines to all participants.

WHO has multiple roles within the COVAX: among other things it supports countries as they prepare to receive and administer vaccines and does so in partnership with UNICEF. It provides normative guidance on vaccine policy, regulation, safety, R&D, allocation, and country readiness and delivery. Its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization develops evidence-based immunization policy recommendations. Its Emergency Use Listing (EUL)/prequalification programmes ensure harmonized review and authorization across member states. It provides global coordination and member state support on vaccine safety monitoring. It developed the target product profiles for COVID-19 vaccines and provides R&D technical coordination. Along with COVAX partners, it is developing a no-fault compensation scheme for indemnification and liability issues. COVAX is part of the Act accelerator which WHO launched with partners in 2020.

About ACT-Accelerator

The Access to COVID-19 Tools ACT-Accelerator, is a new, ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. It was set up in response to a call from G20 leaders in March and launched by the WHO, European Commission, France and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in April 2020.

The ACT-Accelerator is not a decision-making body or a new organisation, but works to speed up collaborative efforts among existing organisations to end the pandemic. It is a framework for collaboration that has been designed to bring key players around the table with the goal of ending the pandemic as quickly as possible through the accelerated development, equitable allocation, and scaled up delivery of tests, treatments and vaccines, thereby protecting health systems and restoring societies and economies in the near term. It draws on the experience of leading global health organisations which are tackling the world’s toughest health challenges, and who, by working together, are able to unlock new and more ambitious results against COVID-19. Its members share a commitment to ensure all people have access to all the tools needed to defeat COVID-19 and to work with unprecedented levels of partnership to achieve it.

The ACT-Accelerator has four areas of work: diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines and the health system connector. Cross-cutting all of these is the workstream on Access & Allocation.",https://www.who.int
31,"The World Health Organization and YouTube have partnered on an inviting and humorous public service announcement (PSA) to help battle COVID-19 fatigue as we head into the holiday season. After nine months of physical distancing, lockdowns and other preventative measures, the video reminds viewers to stay vigilant and continue to take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus as people in many parts of the world head into the holiday season.



Voiced by actor and comedian Jon Glaser (Parks and Rec, Bob’s Burgers, Girls) the short animated video reinforces the WHO’s recommendations that viewers should stay home when possible, wear a mask if they need to go out, wash their hands and stay away from others when in public.



The PSA also gives advice for how to tackle some of the common holiday activities that could lead to further spread of COVID-19, including travel (think twice!), large gatherings (turn around and head home!) and visiting with high-risk relatives (try a video call!).



The PSA is available on YouTube starting today and will be promoted through early January as a pre-roll ad, in features on the YouTube homepage, and in posts from YouTube’s social media handles.

32,"Lack of water puts health care workers and patients at higher risk of COVID-19 infection

Around 1.8 billion people are at heightened risk of COVID-19 and other diseases because they use or work in health care facilities without basic water services, warn WHO and UNICEF.

“Working in a health care facility without water, sanitation and hygiene is akin to sending nurses and doctors to work without personal protective equipment” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Water supply, sanitation and hygiene in health care facilities are fundamental to stopping COVID-19. But there are still major gaps to overcome, particularly in least developed countries.”

The report, Fundamentals first: Universal water, sanitation, and hygiene services in health care facilities for safe, quality care, comes as COVID-19 is exposing key vulnerabilities within health systems, including inadequate infection prevention and control.

Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) are vital to the safety of health workers and patients yet provision of these services is not prioritized. Worldwide, 1 in 4 health care facilities has no water services, 1 in 3 does not have access to hand hygiene where care is provided, 1 in 10 has no sanitation services*, and 1 in 3 does not segregate waste safely.

“Sending healthcare workers and people in need of treatment to facilities without clean water, safe toilets, or even soap puts their lives at risk,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “This was certainly true before the COVID-19 pandemic, but this year has made these disparities impossible to ignore. As we reimagine and shape a post-COVID world, making sure we are sending children and mothers to places of care equipped with adequate water, sanitation and hygiene services is not merely something we can and should do. It is an absolute must.”

The situation is worst of all in the world’s 47 Least Developed Countries (LDCs): 1 in 2 health care facilities does not have basic drinking water, 1 in 4 health care facilities has no hand hygiene facilities at points of care; and 3 in 5 lack basic sanitation services.

But this can be fixed. The report’s preliminary estimates indicate that it would cost roughly USD 1 per capita to enable all 47 LDCs to establish basic water service in health facilities. On average, USD 0.20 per capita is needed each year to operate and maintain services.

According to the report, immediate, incremental investments in WASH have big returns: improving hygiene in health care facilities is a “best buy” for tackling antimicrobial resistance. It reduces health care costs because it reduces health-care associated infections (which are costly to treat). It saves time as health workers do not have to search for water for hand hygiene. Better hygiene also increases uptake of services. This all adds up to a return of USD 1.5 for every dollar invested.

These services are especially critical for vulnerable populations, including pregnant mothers, newborns and children. Improving WASH services in health care facilities is particularly important around childbirth when far too many mothers and newborns suffer and die, including from preventable conditions like sepsis. Better WASH services could save a million pregnant women and newborns’ lives and reduce still-births.

The report provides four main recommendations:

Implement costed national roadmaps with appropriate financing;

Monitor and regularly review progress in improving WASH services, practices and the enabling environment;

Develop capacities of health workforce to sustain WASH services and promote and practice good hygiene;

Integrate WASH into regular health sector planning, budgeting, and programming, including COVID-19 response and recovery efforts to deliver quality services.

Global WASH and health partners have shown their support for meeting global and country WASH in health care facility targets. By 2020, over 130 partners have committed resources, of which 34 have made dedicated financial commitments totalling USD125 million.

Nevertheless, implementation of the 2019 World Health Assembly Resolution on WASH in health care facilities is uneven. Of the nearly 50 countries for which WHO and UNICEF have data, 86 per cent have updated standards and 70 per cent have conducted initial assessments which show that these areas are generally on track. Yet just a third of countries have costed national WASH in health care facility roadmaps and only 10 per cent have included WASH indicators in national health systems monitoring.

More catalytic global funding, technical support, and domestic resourcing is needed to keep health care workers and patients safe and protected. Now, an opportunity exists to build on existing efforts and commitments and integrate WASH in health care facilities in all national COVID-19 plans, vaccine distribution and economic recovery packages.

“For millions of healthcare workers across the world, water is PPE”, said Jennifer Sara, Global Director for Water at the World Bank Group. “It is essential that financing keeps flowing to bring water and sanitation services to those battling the COVID crisis on the frontlines. Funding WASH in healthcare facilities is among the most cost-effective investments that governments can make.”

Data published by WHO in October indicates that COVID-19 infections among health care workers are far greater than those in the general population: Health care workers represent less than 3 per cent of the population, but account for 14 per cent of global COVID-19 cases reported to WHO. Ensuring health care workers have the basic WASH necessities to keep themselves, their patients, their families and children safe - is imperative.

“Millions have no option but to seek care from the 50% of health care facilities in the developing world which don’t have clean water on the premises. This cannot continue. Every day both healthcare workers’ and patients’ lives are being put at risk,” saidTim Wainwright, Chief Executive at international charity WaterAid. “Without frontline health workers being able to wash their hands; provide their patients with clean water; or have somewhere decent to go to the toilet, a hospital is not a hospital at all - it’s a breeding ground for disease.”

Note to Editors:

The data in this year’s report include statistics for 165 countries, from surveys representing 760,000 facilities. Compared to last year’s baseline report, estimates were available for 125 countries with data from surveys representing 560,000 facilities. The data on county progress in implementing the World Health Assembly Resolution represent 47 countries. It is the first time these data have been compiled and analyzed.

Sanitation services are measures taken to ensure the hygienic management of excreta along all stages of the sanitation chain: capture, containment, emptying, transport, treatment and safe disposal.

33,"Funding for community programmes, engaging youth in solutions to address COVID-19, and convening Global Youth Summit are key features of this new mobilization



A new ground-breaking global youth mobilization was launched today to invest in and scale up youth-led solutions and engagements in response to COVID-19. The initiative was launched by an alliance of the world’s largest youth movements and organizations, together with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Foundation.



The “Global Youth Mobilization for Generation Disrupted” is being led by the Big 6 Youth Organizations (Young Men’s Christian Association, YMCA; World Young Women’s Christian Association, YWCA; World Organization of the Scout Movement; World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts; International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, IFRC; and The Duke of Edinburgh’s International Award), which together actively involve more than 250 million young people, and aims to support young people to engage in and design efforts to turn around the impact of the pandemic.



The Global Youth Mobilization will feature the convening of a Global Youth Summit in April 2021, and a fund of US $5 million to support local and national youth organizations, including grants for youth-led solutions and an accelerator programme to scale up existing response efforts.



The leadership of the WHO, Big 6 and youth organizations around the world are calling on governments, businesses and policy makers to back the Global Youth Mobilization effort and commit to investing in the future of young people. These measures will directly support young people engaged at the grassroots level to tackle some of the most pressing health and societal challenges resulting from the pandemic.



“WHO is honoured to join this truly exciting and powerful global movement to mobilize and empower youth worldwide to be the driving force of the recovery to COVID-19,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Joining forces with the Big 6 and the United Nations Foundation provides WHO and the world a unique opportunity to learn from hundreds of millions of young people and be guided by their sustainable solutions to help communities build back better from the pandemic.”

While the direct health impacts of the pandemic on young people have been generally less severe, they are disproportionately affected by the long-lasting consequences of the pandemic. Such effects include disruptions to education, economic uncertainty, loss or lack of employment opportunities, impacts on physical and mental health, and trauma from domestic violence. For example, mental anxiety brought on by COVID-19 has been identified in nearly 90 per cent of young people; more than 1 billion students in almost every country have been impacted by school closures; and 1 in 6 young people worldwide have lost their jobs during the pandemic.



At the same time, young people are also driving change and implementing solutions in response to COVID-19 by taking action through community-based interventions and voluntary service, such as acting as first responders and delivering food and supplies to those in need. The Global Youth Mobilization will draw attention to the urgent need for solutions to support young people, and to highlight the critical leadership role young people are playing in their communities to counter the effects of the pandemic.



“We are proud to team up with the WHO to provide opportunities and funding to help millions of young people across the globe to respond to local challenges related to COVID-19 in their communities,” said the leadership of the Big 6 in a joint statement. “The mobilization will provide direct financial and programmatic support to youth organizations at the national and international level. We believe that young people have the solutions to solve their own problems, and by providing a global youth platform, combined with national activation for youth projects, we can unleash the skills, enthusiasm and desire for young people to be a force for good in their communities.”



Supported by the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for WHO and powered by the United Nations Foundation, the Global Youth Mobilization features a strategic partnership with the WHO and its newly launched Youth Council. It will involve other United Nations agencies, as well as a number of high-profile global partners, brands, and advocates, from FIFA to YOUNGA by BridgingTheGap Ventures, and the creation of a youth council of social media influencers, including the Influential platform. The initiative, developed in consultation with young people from across the globe, will be youth-led, community-driven, evidence-based, and inclusive of diverse communities rooted in meaningful youth participation and engagement.

Today, health services in all regions are struggling to both tackle COVID-19, and provide people with vital care.



In another blow, the pandemic threatens to set back hard-won global health progress achieved over the past two decades - in fighting infectious diseases, for example, and improving maternal and child health.



So in 2021, countries around the world will need to continue battle COVID-19 (albeit with the knowledge that effective tools are evolving). They will need to move swiftly to repair and reinforce their health systems so they can deliver these tools, and to address the key societal and environmental issues that result in some sections of the population suffering so much more than others.

WHO and its partners will be at their side. We will work to help countries strengthen preparedness for pandemics and other emergencies. We will remind them of the importance of bringing countries together and of involving the whole government, not just the health sector. And we will support them in building strong health systems and healthy populations

The World Health Organization (WHO) envisions a world where every pregnant woman and newborn receives quality care throughout the pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period. The importance of nutrition has been recognized as part of this care and a Comprehensive implementation plan on maternal, infant and young child nutrition has been approved by the 65th World Health Assembly.

As part of its unique normative function in health, WHO recommendations on antenatal care for a positive pregnancy experience were developed, which included 14 recommendations related to nutrition. These guidelines were developed in 2016 and are relevant to all pregnant women and adolescent girls receiving antenatal care in any health-care facility or community-based setting. In 2017, the Executive Guideline Steering Group (GSG) on WHO maternal and perinatal health recommendations prioritized the updating of four out of the 14 nutrition recommendations: calcium supplementation, zinc supplementation, vitamin D supplementation and multiple micronutrient supplementation. Updated guidance on calcium supplementation was published in 2018 [1] , while multiple micronutrient and vitamin D supplementation was published in 2020. [2] [3] We are currently updating guidance on the use of zinc supplementation during pregnancy.



Updated evidence reviews have been conducted for zinc supplementation and will be discussed during this guideline development panel meeting by videoconference, using Zoom, on 13 January 2021.



The main objectives of this panel meeting are to:



Present the evidence for informing the update of the recommendation for the WHO antenatal care guidelines for Zinc supplementation;

Draft updated recommendations for the Zinc recommendation, considering benefits, harms, values and preferences, feasibility, equity, ethics, acceptability, resource requirements and other factors, as appropriate;

Define implications for further research and gaps; and

Discuss considerations for the implementation of the recommendations, if necessary.

42,"Cairo, Egypt, 15 December 2020 – Despite remarkable gains in health over the past few decades, the world is not on track to achieve the health-related targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and people, especially the most marginalized, are being left behind. The COVID-19 pandemic is setting progress back even further.

In a landmark move, 12 multilateral health, development and humanitarian agencies in the Eastern Mediterranean/Middle East and North African Regions have virtually launched the Regional Health Alliance, a partnership that aims to support countries to accelerate progress towards the health-related SDGs and facilitate implementation of the Global Action Plan on Healthy Lives and Well-being for All.

The partnership is based on the firm commitments made by the agencies to harmonize their internal strategies, policies and approaches, and to ensure mutual accountability and strengthen collaboration with countries and each other under seven accelerator themes: primary health care; sustainable financing for health; community and civil society engagement; determinants of health; innovative programming in fragile and vulnerable settings; research and development, innovation and access; and data and digital health. Ensuring gender equality as a fundamental human right cuts across all the seven themes.

The WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, inspired by the regional Vision 2023 of Health For All By All, has initiated the Regional Health Alliance to strengthen collaboration, foster new ways of working and operationalize the Global Action Plan. Building on successful existing partnerships, the Regional Health Alliance’s partner agencies will be able to strengthen their collective support to countries to improve the health and well-being of populations in the Region.

Health has a central place in SDG 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages) and its 13 targets. Almost all of the other global SDGs are related to health or contribute to health indirectly, including those to end poverty and reduce inequalities, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health care services, achieve gender equality, grow economies, protect the environment, and promote peaceful and inclusive societies.

The Region is diverse and complex. There is political polarization, and conflicts and natural disasters have added to an already high burden of mortality and morbidity. Through stronger collaboration, the partnership will contribute to and reaching better health as the destination.

Agencies have made four specific, core commitments under the Global Action Plan: 1) engage with countries better to identify priorities and plan and implement together; 2) accelerate progress in countries through joint action under specific accelerator themes and on gender equality and the delivery of global public goods; 3) align in support of countries by harmonizing operational and financial strategies, policies and approaches; and 4) account, by reviewing progress and learning together to enhance shared accountability.

The Alliance is hosted by WHO and comprises regional offices of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), the World Bank Group and World Food Programme (WFP), who are all signatories of the Global Action Plan, as well as the International Organization for Migration (IOM), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Meanwhile the Implementation of the joint activities is engaging additional health and development partners, including civil society organizations.

As one of the objectives of the Global Action Plan is to facilitate the delivery of aligned and coordinated technical support to national plans and strategies that are country-owned and led, representatives from different countries of the Region also participated in the virtual launch event, along with representatives of the 12 agencies, the League of Arab States and community organizations.

43,"23 December 2020 – Almost a year has passed since the COVID-19 pandemic started spreading across the world, putting millions of lives at risk, presenting unprecedented challenges on health systems, and further aggravating already weakened country economies. Health facilities are overwhelmed, and the health care workforce is facing global shortages in capacities, resources, and personal protective equipment, making them the most vulnerable group in the fight against this new threat.

Dr Ahmed Mady, pulmonology consultant at Cairo, Egypt’s Chest Hospital and director of the Health Isolation Hospital in Al-Ajami, who tragically died of COVID-19 in August. (Photo courtesy of Article19.ma)“While I'm lying on my bed in intensive care, I struggle to breathe. I suffer from a terrible pain that eats away at every part of my body, in which there is nothing left that is not connected to pipes and hoses. I watch the gazes of my fellow doctors and nurses, between fear and hope. And I see rapid and turbulent movements to equip the ventilator for a sharp drop of oxygen in my blood,"" said Dr Ahmed Madi, a pulmonology consultant at the Chest Hospital in Egypt, from his hospital bed after testing positive for COVID-19.

""I know the failure of my respiratory system is the beginning of the road to my inevitable end – an end that I have seen before in others. I am the doctor responsible for treating this disease and I can clearly see its end now. All I hope for a speedy end to the moment of separation, and for God to protect my family and my children. I miss them so much,” he added.

Dr Madi died just days after delivering this message to his co-workers.

“Our hearts and thoughts are with the families of those who have lost loved ones. This is not just a loss for them, but a loss for the entire Region, where health staff working in some of the most complex settings in the world are acknowledged and valued for their dedication and commitment,” said Dr Richard Brennan, Director of Health Emergencies.

Compounded threats facing health workers in the Eastern Mediterranean Region

In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, where many health workers already face considerable risks, COVID-19 has added a new layer of complexity to the challenges they face. Beyond working in conflict zones and insecure settings, and being at risk of direct and indirect attacks, health workers are now exposed to an additional threat.

As countries in the Region continue to report increasing numbers of COVID-19 confirmed cases among their populations, the risks facing health workers are also on the rise.

“I wished desperately that COVID-19 wouldn’t reach Yemen, as we are already suffering from cholera, diphtheria, dengue, malaria and malnutrition, compounded with the ongoing conflict that has destroyed an already weak health system,” said Khalid Mohammed, a laboratory technician at the Central Laboratory in Sana’a. “Yes, I’m afraid for my health and my family’s, but if I can help, I will never stay aside. I’m working tirelessly 24 hours to run COVID-19 tests. This is the least I can do,” he added.

While health workers represent less than 3% of the population in most countries and less than 2% in almost all low- and middle-income countries, around 14% of COVID-19 cases reported to WHO are among health workers. In some countries, the proportion can be as high as 35%. Thousands of health workers infected with COVID-19 have lost their lives globally.

“Despite the challenges and risks, health care workers across the Region continue their work, putting the greater good first. They are an example to us all,” said Dr Brennan.

In Yemen, official numbers released by health authorities indicate that there are 407 infections among health care workers out of 2087 confirmed COVID-19 cases announced as 13 December 2020.

“COVID-19 has left Yemen and health care workers on the frontlines under severe pressure. We put our lives at risk to save the lives of our people. I have seen many doctors fall sick and be admitted on ventilators and monitors, or worse, die. This has been the hardest thing to witness,” said Sami Al Hajj, a young doctor working at the Science and Technology Hospital in Sana’a.

From 1 October to 15 December alone, Jordan reported the deaths of 23 doctors, the highest number since the start of the pandemic “We are all sad and in pain over the death of a constellation of heroes who stood as the first line of defence against the pandemic,” said Bisher Al-Khasawneh, Jordan’s Prime Minister, on social media.

Azizullah Asghari, nurse at the ICU unit in Afghan Japan Hospital in Afghanistan, whose mother was infected with COVID-19 after he tested positive. Her death left him with a big loss“At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic no one was ready to work at the Afghan Japan Hospital which is designated for COVID-19 patients here in Kabul, because there were limited resources available to protect health workers, and the risk was very high,” said Mr Azizullah Asghari, an ICU nurse at Afghan Japan Hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan. “But the number of patients were increasing daily, so I decided to take the risk and started working as a nurse in the intensive care unit to help patients in severe or critical condition. Soon after, I became infected, and my family, including my mother, also tested positive. I lost my mother, who was only 42 years old with no underlying condition.”

“I still cannot explain my mother’s death. I felt it with all my soul, there is no wound deeper than losing your loved ones like this. But I want to stand by people and try to save their loved ones. The commitment I made while graduating and the love I have for my people encouraged me to continue my work at the Afghan Japan Hospital and serve the patients with even more energy.”

Among the thousands of health workers in the regional polio programme who support the COVID-19 response, almost 256 polio staff have been infected, and three have lost their lives.

Making sure health care workers are protected physically and mentally

Health workers are at highest group at risk of infection due to frequent and close contact with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients. Global shortages of personal protective equipment have also made health workers soft targets, and those who have access to personal protective equipment may not be well trained enough to use them properly. Weak infection prevention and control measures in health facilities treating COVID-19 patients also increase their risk of exposure and infection.

While many health workers are infected in hospitals and health facilities, some are also infected due to exposure to the virus in community settings, including households.

But contracting COVID-19 is not the only risk that health workers face. With many frontline workers in close contact with infected patients, health workers are sometimes discriminated against as potential carriers of the disease and exposed to stigma and sometimes violence.

“I understand the fear of health care workers. It is a justified fear given the deteriorating health situation. But our people need us and our experience. I urge myself and fellow doctors to work this out together and support each other during this challenging time to survive the pandemic,” said Sami Al Hajj from the Science and Technology Hospital in Sana’a.

Exposed to levels of illness and death never seen before, some health workers are also at risk of psychological and emotional disturbances, illness and even death.

As the pandemic takes its toll on the mental health of health care workers. WHO and health partners are working hard to make sure that no one is left behind. Frontlines health workers are supported with mental health packages providing practical guidance and advice to help them cope up with the pressures faced.

Despite the global shortages in personal protective equipment, WHO and health partners have scaled up delivery. As of 15 December 2020, a total of 290 shipments of personal protective equipment kits have been shipped to 6 countries in Region from WHO’s regional logistics hub in Dubai, along with other medicines and equipment to support the COVID-19 response. Also, WHO and health partners have supported training health care workers across the region on infection, prevention and control guidance to reduce the risk of the virus spreading in health care settings. WHO also offers free courses on its Open WHO platform to train health workers on use of PPEs and other IPC measures properly.",http://www.emro.who.int
44,"20 December 2020 – On 12 December 2020, in line with global celebrations of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Day, the World Health Organization (WHO) in Somalia joined the Federal Government of Somalia, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), to raise awareness about the importance of achieving UHC in fragile and vulnerable states, with the aim of ensuring health for all across the country for everyone, everywhere.

At an event hosted in Mogadishu by the Federal Ministry of Health and Human Services of Somalia, with support from WHO, key representatives from the Federal Government, Federal Member States, Members of Parliament, other government agencies, international and donor community, civil society and representatives of United Nations agencies participated. The aim of the event was to raise awareness of the need to build strong and resilient health systems in Somalia and to mark the anniversary of the United Nations historic and unanimous endorsement of UHC in 2012 calling the countries to provide affordable, quality health care to every person, everywhere (A/RES/74/2).

Befitting the theme of 2020‘s UHC Day- “Health for All: Protect Everyone” the event preceded with a discussion on the UHC road map for Somalia, progress achieved to date and how the government, United Nations agencies and civil society could work together to improve health service delivery, ensure access to care, as well as build stronger health systems as the country recovers from the pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

During the event, Dr Fawziya Abikar Nur, the Federal Minister of Health and Human Services of Somalia, said that UHC would strengthen health systems, particularly after having witnessed the impact that health emergencies, such as the COVID-19, had had on the social and economic development of a country.

Dr Fawziya Abikar Nur, the Federal Minister of Health and Human Services of Somalia

On behalf of United Nations agencies in Somalia, the acting United Nations Resident Coordinator and the Resident Representative of UNDP Mr Jocelyn Mason spoke on the occasion.

WHO Representative for Somalia Dr Mamunur Rahman Malik emphasized that UHC Day was a reminder to all that health remains a right for everyone and that health care should be affordable and accessible for every citizen in every country. Dr Malik reminded all that increased public financing, monitoring out-of-pocket catastrophic expenditure and government ownership were all critical for achieving UHC.

WHO Representative for Somalia Dr Mamunur Rahman Malik

The WHO Representative also emphasized that health services in fragile states like Somalia should be designed and organized in a way that made health care accessible to vulnerable populations, especially internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugees, migrants and people living with disabilities who were often marginalized and excluded from social safety nets.



How the concept of UHC came about

Inspired by and as a follow up to an initial United Nations resolution passed in 2015 on making progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (A/RES/70/1), the United Nations General Assembly convened a high-level meeting on UHC on 23 September 2019. Held under the theme “Universal Health Coverage: Moving Together to Build a Healthier World,” this meeting aimed to accelerate progress toward UHC, particularly with regard to financial risk protection and access to affordable, quality essential health-care services, in efforts to leave no one behind in the field of health.

Taking the opportunity to build back better

In 2020, in response to the swiftly-spreading COVID-19 pandemic in Somalia, the Federal Government of Somalia and partners launched an urgent and robust response to ensure the country was able to test, track and monitor and care for cases of COVID-19.

Taking into account lessons learned and best practices used to curb the spread of the COVID-19, the Government and partners agreed to use the response to the pandemic as an opportunity to build back better, and recover better and stronger. Since primary health care is the backbone of UHC, interventions to strengthen access to health at community and household levels will be prioritized.

Renewing commitment to UHC

Speaking on behalf of United Nations agencies, particularly UNICEF, UNFPA and WHO, the Resident Representative of UNDP and the acting United Nations Resident Coordinator Mr Jocelyn Mason reiterated that the UN system would redouble its efforts to support the Government of Somalia’s vision and desire to achieve UHC in the country.

He also announced a 3-point plan that UNICEF, UNFPA and WHO in Somalia are partnering and committing to in 2021 to take meaningful strides towards UHC. The 3 agencies, as the principal signatories of Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being, have pledged to work together to improve health in 3 critical areas which will be pivotal in reducing deaths from preventable causes, especially among children and women in the country:

First, the 3 agencies plan to scale up the availability of oxygen at the primary health care level, leveraging on the COVID-19 response.

This intervention will save the lives of at least 20-30% of an estimated 15 000 children aged under 5 who lose their lives to pneumonia every year. The intervention will also contribute to the WHO/UNICEF’s Integrated Global Action Plan for Prevention of Diarrhoea and Pneumonia by 2025. Scaling up the availability of oxygen will also improve emergency obstetric care across the country.

Second, in honour of health personnel in Somalia, and given that 2021 has been designated as the “International Year of Health and Care Workers”, UNICEF, UNFPA and WHO will invest in the readiness, education and learning of the health workforce, particularly health workers and midwives at the community level.

These investments have the potential to change the health situation, public and private health systems, and human rights in Somalia forever. Midwifery, in particular, provides a strong opportunity to impact the health and well-being of women and children.

Third, the 3 agencies will strive to ensure every child is immunized against common and preventable childhood diseases, as immunization is a basic pillar of child survival and a strategy to end disease outbreaks.

While Somalia has made some progress in immunization coverage over the past 5 years, vulnerable children living in urban, remote rural and nomadic communities are missed regularly. Furthermore, the 2020 Health and Demographic Survey report for Somalia indicates that only 11% of children aged 12–23 months had received all basic vaccinations. By intensifying cold chain expansion, community engagement and outreach services, as part of the newly updated essential package of health services meant for all, this situation can be turned around. These efforts would also contribute to a successful reproductive health programme aimed at reducing high maternal deaths in the country.

A pledge of health for all and protection for all sounds like a colossal undertaking, and is by no means a small feat. However, with partnerships and action, it can be achieved. As Somalia begins its new journey to rebuild its health systems in the aftermath of the pandemic, on behalf of the UN, Dr Malik urged all health and development partners, civil society and other actors to collaborate, forge strong partnerships, and align their work towards attaining the dream of UHC in Somalia, even in the most fragile and vulnerable settings.",http://www.emro.who.int

48,"Global partners that are committed to ending paediatric AIDS have come together to call on countries to rapidly scale up access to optimal, child-friendly HIV treatment for infants and children. The partners include the United Nations Children’s Fund, the World Health Organization (WHO), UNAIDS, the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, Unitaid, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, and the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI).

Children living with HIV continue to be left behind by the global AIDS response. In 2019, only 53% (950 000) of the 1.8 million children living with HIV (aged 0–14 years) globally were diagnosed and on treatment, compared to 68% of adults.[1] The remaining 850 000 children living with HIV have not been diagnosed and are not receiving life-saving HIV treatment. Two thirds of the missing children are aged 5–14 years and do not routinely attend traditional health facilities. Engaging communities and the families of people living with HIV, tuberculosis and other related diseases and offering family services are needed in order to find and start on treatment those missing children.

An estimated 95 000 children died of AIDS-related illnesses in 2019, in part due to lack of early diagnosis of HIV among infants and children and immediate linkage to optimal HIV treatment regimens. Untreated, 50% of infants infected with HIV during or around the time of birth will die before the age of two years.[1]

The United States Food and Drug Administration recently gave tentative approval for the first generic formulation of dolutegravir (DTG) 10 mg dispersible tablets.[2] This approval was the result of an innovative partnership between Unitaid, CHAI and ViiV Healthcare, together with generic suppliers, which accelerated the timeline of development by several years. The approval was quickly followed by the announcement on World AIDS Day of a groundbreaking agreement negotiated by Unitaid and CHAI that reduces the cost of HIV treatment by 75% for children in low- and middle-income countries, where the DTG 10 mg dispersible tablets will be available at a cost of US$ 4.50 for a 90-count bottle.[3]

This now means that WHO-recommended, preferred first line DTG-based antiretroviral treatment is now available in more affordable and child-friendly generic formulations for young children and infants as young as four weeks of age and weighing more than 3 kg.[4] Rapid transition to this optimal treatment regimen, in combination with improved HIV diagnosis for children and other supportive measures, will help to urgently reduce the 95 000 preventable AIDS-related deaths in children.

DTG-based HIV treatment leads to better outcomes for children. DTG is less likely to be affected by drug resistance and achieves viral load suppression sooner; child-friendly dispersible tablets improve adherence due to a lower pill burden and being easier to administer. These factors help children achieve and maintain viral load suppression, the gold standard for measuring the effectiveness of HIV treatment. DTG-based treatment is the standard of care for adults. Starting on this regimen from infancy reduces the need for changes in treatment as they mature through childhood, adolescence and adulthood. Fewer regimens and regimen changes simplifies management of health care, improves stock management and reduces wastage.

WHO has recommended DTG-based HIV treatment for all infants and children since 2018[4] and provided dosing recommendations for infants and children over four weeks of age and more than 3 kg in July 2020.[5]

Suppliers have indicated their ability to meet global scale-up ambitions. Accurate forecasts of demand are critical to inform production planning and delivery timelines. It is therefore critical that national programmes start including DTG 10 mg dispersible tablets in their new procurement plans, review stocks and orders for existing non-DTG treatment for children, share forecasts with HIV treatment procurement partners and suppliers and place orders as early as possible.

The partners are committed to support national governments as they develop rapid transition plans from existing suboptimal HIV treatment to DTG-based treatment for infants and children, including advocacy for political commitment, mobilizing international and domestic resources, new policies and guidelines, managing medicine supply, distribution and stock, training health-care workers and sensitizing and engaging affected communities to ensure demand and treatment literacy for children living with HIV and their caregivers in order to ensure rapid uptake of these new formulations.

Further guidance for national programmes and partners is available from WHO.[5] The CHAI HIV New Product Introduction Toolkit has dedicated resources to help countries transition to paediatric DTG.[6]

Quotes from partners

“This has the potential to be a true game-changer for children with HIV"", said Meg Doherty, Director of Global HIV, Hepatitis and STI Programmes at WHO. “We must do all in our power to help countries get this new paediatric DTG 10 mg to all the children who need it.""

“National governments, partners on the ground and affected communities need to work together to find and treat the children and infants whose lives can be saved by these new medicines,” said Shannon Hader, UNAIDS Executive Director for Programme. “The new medicines are cheaper, more effective and more child-friendly than current treatments for infants and young children. We need to get them into clinics to save lives now.”

“Providing antiretroviral drugs to people living with HIV is at the core of our support to national HIV programmes,” said Peter Sands, Executive Director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. “This new and affordable child-friendly HIV treatment is a tremendous step forward that will improve and save the lives of some of the most vulnerable in society—young children infected with HIV. We are committed to support countries to make a fast transition to these new drugs.”

“Children in low- and middle-income countries often wait years to access the same medications as adults, hindering their quality of life, or even resulting in preventable deaths. We are proud to have worked with partners on this groundbreaking agreement that will bring quality assured dispersible DTG to children at a record pace,” said Philippe Duneton, Unitaid Executive Director. “Ensuring access to this treatment will transform the lives of children living with HIV, helping them to remain on treatment and saving thousands of lives.”

“For the first time, children living with HIV in low- and middle-income countries will have access to the same first-line antiretroviral medication at the same time as those in high-income countries,” said Iain Barton, Chief Executive Officer of the Clinton Health Action Initiative. “The partnership should serve as a model to remove barriers that hinder development of paediatric formulations to deliver top-line medications quickly and affordably.”

“The persistent treatment gap between adults and children prevents us from achieving an AIDS-free generation,” said Chip Lyons, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. “Children living with HIV around the world urgently require age-appropriate, effective and accessible formulations. Approval of dispersible DTG is a momentous step forward, but meaningless if this new formulation doesn’t quickly reach the babies and small children who desperately need it most. The Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation is committed to supporting accelerated roll-out, uptake and delivery of new, optimal paediatric antiretroviral medicines in partnership with global, regional and local leaders.”

“The persisting treatment gap between mothers and children is unacceptable with the new scientific breakthroughs that are within our reach to change the trajectory”, said Chewe Luo, Associate Director and Chief of HIV, United Nations Children’s Fund. “The United Nations Children’s Fund welcomes global commitments and progress made in developing better diagnostic approaches and optimal regimens for children to improve their outcomes.”

The 1+1 Initiative has expanded to include thousands of youth across the world in countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, India, Indonesia, Philippines, and Vietnam.

The social media platforms set up as part of the 1+1 youth initiative are joined and followed by more than 15000 young people including WHO End TB forum.

Similarly, Global TB Programme has established #Youth2EndTB Global Youth Network where more than 1800 youths from 95+ countries have already joined. Besides, in order to recognise the youth efforts and encourage youth engagement on ending TB, youth story series was conducted.

Moreover, 50 and more different youth-led activities and virtual events on ending TB have been conducted worldwide. This includes sensitizing young people, peer education trainings in schools and universities,and encouraging them to become TB advocates, and supporting TB patients in the community with resources, advice, and encouragement. In addition, we are enthusiastic about cross country youth dialogue series that have been started where youths from different countries can participate and learn from each other.

For instance, one of the inspiring examples is that of Nepal, young people in this country have established national and provincial youth networks to help young people, through capacity building and in ensuring their participation in policy making and community level awareness building programmes.

Likewise, in March 2020, Vietnam National Tuberculosis program launched National Youth Movement against TB which aims on reaching 10 million young people as well as educating all primary school students with TB knowledge and good practices on combating TB and lung diseases.

Another exciting example is from Indonesia. Their national youth movement against TB has been conducting Art exhibitions as well as creating TB awareness through social media campaign.

Furthermore, WHO Global TB Program is currently developing training manual targeting End TB youth leaders, young survivors, and young health professionals. It will be available at End TB channel of Open WHO platform after completing it's six regional youth consultations.

Midwives and nurses—the overwhelming majority of whom are women—are the backbone of primary health systems. Their care during this monumental year has had an impact far beyond the facilities in which they work.

However, the dedication that midwives and nurses have epitomized throughout the onslaught of the pandemic often goes unrecognized and merits much more than applause: more investment, more support, safe and decent work, equal pay, more resources, and an equal say in leadership.



Despite shortages of Physical Protective Equipment (PPE), a lack of support, and crippling uncertainty, these women represent millions more nurses and midwives on the frontlines of patient care, providing solutions, every day, to people around the globe.

Let us use the stories of their everyday heroism and service to call for all countries to invest in decent work and a new social contract for all women health workers, particularly, nurses and midwives as part of their commitment to health for all. Above all, we want nurses and midwives to have an equal say in decision making on the health systems they know best.",https://www.who.int/news-room

53,"Spend a few minutes in any playground, nursery or home, and you will probably hear a common request of young children: “Don’t put your fingers in your mouth.” Parents and caregivers repeatedly try to shield their children from germs – either viruses or bacteria – that can lead to common colds or serious infections, like pneumonia.

Infants and toddlers love to crawl on the ground and put their fingers in their mouths, but their immature immune systems render them more susceptible to diseases, including those caused by drug-resistant microbes present in the people, animals and food to which they are exposed.

Today, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major and growing threat to health and human development, affecting our ability to effectively treat a range of infections with antibiotics, including urinary tract infections, sepsis, and some forms of diarrhoea. ‘Superbugs’ or bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics, are also becoming more prevalent.

Children, especially those living in low-resource settings with limited access to health services face an even greater risk. Lack of safe water, poor sanitary conditions and hygiene practices, and inadequate infection control, further enables the spread of AMR.

Resistance to treatments, like antiretrovirals, antimalarials, anti-Tuberculosis (TB) drugs, and antifungal drugs threatens to reverse progress in reducing child mortality. In low-income countries, where most childhood deaths are occurring, effective and accessible antibiotics are absolutely essential for treating the most common childhood diseases – malaria, pneumonia, other respiratory infections, and dysentery, as well as other conditions such as bacterial blood infections. If these drugs become resistant, children’s chances of survival are threatened.

The data speak for themselves. Today, around 2 million children are exposed to multidrug-resistant TB, and a further 5 million to Rifampicin-resistant TB. One out of every two infants newly diagnosed with HIV is infected with a virus already harboring resistance to the most commonly used first-line antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, with resistance to first-line ARVs being as high as 63.7% in infants diagnosed with HIV.

In addition, rapidly increasing antibiotic resistance in bacteria means several classes of antibiotics traditionally used to combat common but potentially deadly infections in children, such as diarrhoea, pneumonia and neonatal sepsis, are no longer effective.

Yet, AMR is not the only threat to children’s chances to survive and thrive. Lack of access to quality and affordable antimicrobials, particularly in low-resource settings disrupts the ability to treat infections in the first place. In 2016 alone, many of the estimated 6.3 million deaths among children under 5 were caused by infectious diseases which could have been averted by increased access to antibiotics.

At the same time, we also know that resistance develops more rapidly through the misuse and overuse of antimicrobial medicines, especially as antibiotic use in humans is increasing. While it is essential that children get the full-course antimicrobials at the right time and when needed, it is also important that health workers and caregivers guard against AMR by avoiding mis- or over-use of antimicrobials.

As part of World Antimicrobial Awareness Week, WHO and partners aim to increase awareness of AMR and encourage best practices among the public, health workers and policy makers. But they also aim to bring to the forefront, children’s rights to health. World Children’s Day, which falls at the same time, is an opportunity to celebrate and reflect upon our collective efforts to ensure that children’s rights, including their rights to good health and health care – are respected, protected and fulfilled.

Having the right to health means being entitled to quality health care, including access to essential drugs and medicines, such as antimicrobials. It also means having a right to access appropriate health information, including on the proper use of antimicrobials and the risks associated with their mis- or overuse.

Guided by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, recognition of children’s right to health requires governments to develop and implement policies and regulations that ensure children and their caregivers have equitable access to antimicrobials, and to inform them on when and how to use the medicine. In addition, policies, regulations and protocols must be in place to prevent over prescription of antimicrobials by health professionals and to avoid over-the-counter sales.

While we cannot fully stop children from putting their fingers in their mouths, we can better protect them from the increasing threat of AMR. Children must not be left behind in the global AMR response. Their unique needs and vulnerabilities must be addressed and their rights to health upheld.",https://www.who.int/news-room

55,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory disease first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. So far, around 80% of cases are registered in Saudi Arabia, with only a small number of infections in Europe.

Since 2012, MERS cases have been reported cases across continents. Some European countries have treated cases, including Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey and the United Kingdom. Most of the cases were imported and did not result in further spread of the virus: in only few cases, further transmission occurred to family members or other contacts. The last case was reported in Germany in March 2015.

WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (for example, consumption of raw camel milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting).

Typical MERS symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is common and approximately 35% of reported patients have died. The virus does not seem to pass easily from person to person unless there is close contact, such as occurs when providing unprotected care to a patient.

58,"Since the mid-1980s, Member States of the WHO European Region have been reporting essential health-related statistics to the Health for All (HFA) family of databases, making it one of WHO’s oldest sources of data. As it is based on reported data, rather than estimates, the HFA family of databases is also particularly valuable.

HFA databases bring together the indicators that are part of major monitoring frameworks relevant to the Region, such as Health 2020 and the Sustainable Development Goals. The indicators cover basic demographics, health status, health determinants and risk factors, as well as health care resources, expenditures and more.

HFA databases allow access to regional, national and some subnational indicators and metadata, which are visualized through interactive online tools in the Health for All explorer. Data, metadata, graphs and maps can be exported or shared online and on social media.

Where do the data come from?

HFA data are compiled from various sources, including a network of country experts, WHO/Europe's technical programmes, and partner organizations such as the statistical office of the European Union (Eurostat), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and United Nations agencies. Data are updated annually.

WHO/Europe constantly upgrades its online databases and analysis tools to make it easier to access and visualize the indicators. Data are now integrated into the WHO/Europe Data Warehouse with a public application programming interface (API).

HFA is now part of the European Health Information Gateway

The integrated HFA databases are now a part of the European Health Information Gateway, a website that shows data in themes and makes it easy for users to visualize information and use integrated information discovery tools.

WHO/Europe lends technical support to SEEHN’s various health projects, based on the Sub-Regional Cooperation Strategy signed bilaterally in Tel-Aviv on 10 July 2018.

On 1 January 2010, SEEHN took over ownership of the regional cooperation for health and development under the auspices of the Regional Cooperation Council (RCC) and the SEE Regional Cooperation Process. RCC’s main purpose is to provide leadership, sustain ownership by the member countries and maintain the concerted health development action launched with the Dubrovnik Pledge (2001), and maintained through the Skopje Pledge (2005) and the Memorandum of Understanding (2008).

Background

In 1999, the international community established the Stability Pact for south-eastern Europe (SEE) as a conflict-prevention and reconstruction process in the region. In 2001, a health component was added to the Pact’s social cohesion initiative, to bring people together across borders to improve health in the whole region. SEEHN has received political, technical and financial support from 10 partner countries and 5 international organizations.

For over a decade, SEEHN has been the undisputed vehicle of health development in the areas of mental health, communicable diseases, food safety and nutrition, blood safety, tobacco control, information systems, maternal and neonatal health, public health services and health systems.

63,"WHO/Europe is supporting countries in the WHO European Region following the report of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant on 14 December 2020 by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Support has included: the assessment of risks; recommendations on virological studies, sequencing and vaccination; guidance on measures; and risk communication. Partner coordination and information sharing has been at the base of the response.

SARS-CoV-2 variant reported to WHO by United Kingdom national authorities

A total of 1108 confirmed cases of a new variant virus, referred to as VUI – 202012/01, have been detected in the United Kingdom as of 13 December 2020. This variant, which includes a range of genetic changes, has spread predominantly in south-east England.

Scientists from the United Kingdom are undertaking a series of urgent epidemiological and virological investigations to further determine the impact of any change on viral properties, such as transmission, disease severity, antibody response or vaccine efficacy.

WHO risk assessment

All viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, change as they circulate. These changes can lead to changes in characteristics of the virus. This is why WHO monitors changes closely, and why everyone must continue to take all actions to slow and eventually stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

This new variant detected in the United Kingdom has several combinations of mutations, particularly in the S gene, and there are preliminary signs that the variant may be able to spread more easily between people. There is also preliminary information that the variant may affect the performance of some diagnostic tools; it is thus important to adapt testing to detect this variant. There is currently no indication of any change in disease severity, but this is also under investigation.

Continued virus circulation is likely to result in many more mutations over time. This is why it is key that any new variants are identified through sequencing and assessed for their public health impact. WHO advises that further virological studies be conducted to understand the specific mutations described in the United Kingdom.

WHO recommendations

WHO advises all countries to increase the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 viruses where possible, share sequence data internationally, and report if the same mutations of concern are found.

It is key to stop spread at its source. All the basic public health and social measures that are known to work need to be continued. These include testing, isolating and caring for cases, contact tracing and quarantine, as well as individual protective measures for everyone, such as hand hygiene, physical distancing and mask wearing.

The more people get vaccinated, the more the circulation of the virus will be reduced and its potential for new mutations and variants will decrease.

Regarding international travel, WHO recommends taking a risk-based approach to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 across borders, while avoiding unnecessary interference with international traffic. Some countries have introduced travel restrictions as a time-limited, precautionary measure in consideration of their domestic situation. Essential travel should always be prioritized and facilitated.",http://www.euro.who.int

67,"Health care systems in Czechia had to adapt to many challenges during COVID-19, one of which was caring for patients with diabetes. WHO supported the use of telemedicine, including continuous glucose monitoring technologies, to allow patients to share personal health data with doctors at a distance, enabling many to stay in control of their diabetes during the pandemic.

Distance care is vital given that diabetic patients who become infected with COVID-19 are at a higher risk of suffering with severe complications from the virus. This is especially true for patients whose condition was not under control prior to catching the virus. Access to treatment and care was made more difficult by disruption to health care services during the pandemic.

""Countries with community transmission of COVID-19 were the most affected by the disruption of health care services,” says Dr Srđan Matić, WHO representative in the Czech Republic. “Introducing telemedicine in the Czech Republic has been a game changer to continue the provision of essential health services while the virus was spreading in the community.”

Telemedicine limits disruption

Sharing health information at a distance allows patients to receive electronic prescriptions for antidiabetic drugs, without needing to visit a doctor’s office. Modern diabetes technologies, like continuous glucose monitoring or smart glucose meters, as well as phone calls, emails and video calls, are also useful. Other methods of data sharing include exporting data from smart devices or creating charts using spreadsheets.

“Telemedicine can be used to check diabetic foot ulcers by examining photographs,” highlights Dr Martin Prázný from the Czech Diabetes Society. “This method, along with the use of clouds to share data from continuous glucose monitoring or smart glucose meters, demonstrates great progress made towards maintaining a high level of diabetes care,"" he adds.

While it was possible to maintain the stable condition of many patients without any disruption, some disparities emerged limiting the use of telemedicine for patients who were older or those with lower socioeconomic status or a cognitive impairment. This needs to be taken into account in the management of patients with limited access to health care.

Diabetes and COVID-19

Adequate health care and good communication between medical staff and patients are keys to the successful management of diabetes, reports Dr Prazny, adding that ""inadequately controlled diabetes can impair the function of the immune system, thus increasing the body's susceptibility to COVID-19, and may also be associated with poor outcomes”.

Dr Prazny stresses the importance of prevention, early diagnosis, and appropriate treatment of the disease. He explains that therapy for diabetic patients with COVID-19 is more challenging because of fluctuations in blood sugar levels and the presence of other diabetic complications, especially those affecting the cardiovascular system.

According to the Czech Diabetes Society, diabetes affects 10.2% of the adult population in the country, with 80% of patients being treated with antidiabetics. Unknown cases of diabetes may represent another 1–2% of the total population, with the number increasing over time in men, and decreasing slightly in women.",http://www.euro.who.int

Copenhagen, 18 December 2020

The winter holidays mark the end of what has been an incredibly difficult year for everyone. The terrible impact of the pandemic means that the need to come together feels perhaps stronger than ever.

As we approach the holiday season, transmission across much of Europe remains intense and widespread. There have been close to 23 million cases of COVID-19 in Europe this year.

Tragically, as of yesterday, more than half a million of those with confirmed infections have lost their lives. The daily reported number of new COVID-19 deaths continues at the highest rates seen since the beginning of the year. As we come to the end of the year, I would like to reflect on the human toll this pandemic continues to inflict on our lives.

Overall, the devastation of the pandemic has been far-reaching and relentless, with lost lives and livelihoods. COVID-19 has forced families and communities apart, bankrupted businesses, and deprived people of opportunities that a year ago were taken for granted.

What has resulted is a growing mental health crisis in Europe.

From anxieties around virus transmission, the psychological impact of lockdowns and self-isolation, to the effects of unemployment, financial worries and social exclusion – the mental health impact of the pandemic will be long-term and far-reaching.

National surveys undertaken during the initial stages of the pandemic revealed that a third or more of the adult population were distressed. An International Labour Organization survey on COVID-19 and young people found that due to the pandemic, 1 in 2 young people (aged 18–29 years) are subject to depression and anxiety, and 1 in 6 are probably affected. Up to 20% of health care workers are suffering from anxiety and depression.

It is clear that even though the impact has varied, no demographic or age group has been spared.

The mental health toll of COVID-19 will be compounded by anxieties that often present during the winter and holiday season. We cannot underestimate the impact this can have on our friends, our families and our own mental health.

Without the traditional physical support networks to rely on, it is vital we take steps to counter the mental health impact on individuals and our communities in any way we can.

In this season of giving, protecting our own mental health and well-being, and promoting that of others, is one of the best gifts we can give.

This has not been an easy year for anyone, and if you are feeling low or anxious, you are not enduring this experience alone.

Everyone has a different way of coping, but there are many tools to mitigate feelings of anxiety or depression. From getting out into nature (where permitted) and keeping active to structuring and planning your days – doing things differently can be immensely restorative. At the heart of caring for each other is finding ways to connect, as well as offering and accepting support.

Mental health challenges remain deeply stigmatized in many communities. Community sensitization to the spectrum of mental health challenges will be important as the true scale of the crisis becomes clearer. Specialized care and support services need to be sustained for those in the grip of more severe mental health challenges.

As we prepare for festivities over the next few weeks, whatever modified form they take, let us build on the collective spirit that has helped us navigate the last few months together.

COVID-19 has shown us that we are part of a community, enduring a shared experience. Despite the physical distance, we have an opportunity to connect and care. The many social networking tools we have at our fingertips make it easier to reach out. The holiday season is the perfect excuse to reconnect.

Let us mobilize our social and community networks as well as the support services that are a lifeline for the marginalized, isolated and those in need of continuing care and treatment. As mental health services have been stretched and reduced because of pandemic response, it is imperative that health systems have the resources to catch up in 2021.

And finally, our health, social care and essential workers have been the centre of our COVID-19 response. Without them we have no way through this pandemic. While prioritization of their psychosocial support needs is urgent and vital now, in the long term we must develop a way to value their courage and contribution more concretely.

We expect to see a larger number of people facing more severe mental health challenges in the coming months as the reality of this experience takes hold. In acknowledgement of the growing crisis, I am calling for concerted action to invest in stronger mental health care services, particularly those that bring care to the community or utilize digital care to reduce obstacles to vital assistance.

It is not worth the risk.

While families debate how to spend their holidays, I have a final appeal to make. There remains a difference between what you are being permitted to do by your authorities and what you should do. The safest thing right now is to remain at home.

Ahead of the winter holiday weeks, here are my three key messages to you:

Recognize that even if separated from your loved ones, you are not alone. Reignite the collective spirit that has seen us through the crisis: reach out, connect and support. Remember that the safest thing to do is to stay at home.

My family, including my elderly parents and I, have made the difficult decision to spend the holidays apart and at home. I am holding myself accountable with a reassurance that next year we can hope to be together again.

My wish for 2021 is for each and every one of us and our communities to be safe and healthier. With the early stages of vaccine roll-out, I think there is much to look forward to.

We have a few more months of sacrifice ahead and can behave now in a way that we are collectively proud of. When we look back on these unprecedented times, I hope we all feel that we acted with a spirit of shared humanity to protect those in need.

Sending my thoughts across the Region. Please play it safe and stay healthy.",http://www.euro.who.int
70,"Slovenia has come a long way to become one of the most successful countries in the WHO European Region in the fight against cervical cancer. From having had one of the worst statistics in Europe on cervical cancer incidence, Slovenia has managed to turn the tide thanks to political will, cooperation and a robust screening programme.

A shared vision for change

Slovenia established its national cancer registry in the 1960s, which enabled Slovenian health authorities to track cancer incidence. A notable increase in cervical cancer rates in the 1990s sounded the alarm among experts, and led to the establishment of ZORA, Slovenia’s national cervical cancer screening programme.

“We used to have statistics among the worst of Europe – our cervical cancer incidence was really high,” explains Dr Urska Ivanuš, Head of ZORA. “With ZORA, managed by the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana, we built a population-based, centralized and comprehensive programme which soon delivered very concrete, tangible results: cervical cancer incidence has almost halved since we established ZORA.”

Dr Ivanuš describes one of the keys to such a remarkable accomplishment: “One of the important factors for success is a shared vision of the stakeholders, which should be led by the example of the core team. Believing in evidence, believing in the cause, working hard and with enthusiasm, listening and understanding all the stakeholders, monitoring and adjusting – all of this is crucial for the successful implementation of change.”

Regular rather than opportunistic screenings

Through ZORA, the practice of opportunistic screening – offering ad hoc screening tests to women visiting health centres for other reasons – was abandoned. Opportunistic screening has proven to have very limited impact on cervical cancer incidence. Instead, ZORA started screening women once every 3 years.

“There were some concerns we might miss out on cancers, but it turned out to be quite the contrary,” explains Dr Ivanuš. As the changes to the screening frequency were implemented, the rate of women with positive results requiring a call-back dropped from 15% to 5%.

“In short: we managed to screen more women, monitor results more efficiently, report back better to screening providers and also back to women themselves, and achieve better overall results,” says Dr Ivanuš. “Our ZORA team had a dream. Now that dream is a concrete plan: a plan to eliminate cervical cancer!”

Never wait for the first signs

The ZORA programme has been well accepted among Slovenian women, and more than 70% now attend screenings regularly.

“Women should think about screenings as part of a healthy lifestyle. Just as they do their daily exercise or try to eat healthy, they should make sure they are screened regularly. This is an important message we should convey to all women. Don’t wait for the first signs, as they will come late,” stresses Dr Ivanuš.

“Cervical cancer is one of the rare cancers where we can actually detect what is called ‘pre-cancer’. It can be a very small change in the cervix, limited to the surface, and if we catch it and treat it, we can prevent cancer from developing,” says Dr Ivanuš. “Cervical cancer is also the only cancer where we have 2 important, safe and effective public health interventions available: screening and vaccination.”

The 90–70–90 targets

“We can see global momentum, and we have the necessary tools for success. But to eliminate cervical cancer, we must achieve 3 crucial targets,” explains WHO Representative in Slovenia Dr Aiga Rurane:

90% of girls fully vaccinated with the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine by 15 years of age;

70% of women screened using a high-performance test by age 35 and again by age 45; and

90% of women identified with cervical cancer treated.

“For maximum impact, these 90–70–90 targets must be implemented simultaneously,” adds Dr Rurane.

With remarkable results for 2 of the targets – 70% of women screened and 90% of women identified with cervical cancer treated – Slovenia could very well become one of the first European countries to reach all 3 targets.

“We have not yet reached the benchmark of vaccinating 90% of girls. Slovenia has been vaccinating girls in the 6th grade of primary school against HPV free of charge since 2009. But the routine vaccination programme is attended by 60% of these girls, which is not enough to achieve the desired population-wide effects of the vaccination,” explains Dr Ivanuš.

“We need to increase coverage, implement primary HPV screening with more accurate tests that enable longer screening intervals, and strengthen the monitoring system,” she adds.

“Our success so far has been possible thanks to the continued efforts and dedicated work for many years of many health professionals in Slovenia, multiple partnerships, and the continued commitment of the Government,” says Dr Rurane. “Slovenia can be proud of what has been achieved, and it sets an example for countries across the Region and globally.”",http://www.euro.who.int
71,"Winter holidays are a time for family, community and renewal. This year more than ever, across the WHO European Region, people are anxious to gather together and reflect on what has been both an extraordinary and difficult 2020.

Annually across Europe, we see a massive increase in gatherings that bring together people of all ages, including families, religious groups and friends. This brings a significant risk of increased COVID-19 transmission during the upcoming holiday season.

Despite some fragile progress, COVID-19 transmission across the European Region remains widespread and intense. There is a high risk of further resurgence in the first weeks and months of 2021, and we will need to work together if we are to succeed in preventing it.

WHO makes a plea that everyone take the following points to heart.

We must all play our part to prevent yet another resurgence of cases in Europe.

Individual decisions this winter holiday won’t just affect you and the people closest to you – they will also impact your communities.

Do not underestimate the importance of your decisions and your power – as an individual, a family or a community – to influence what happens next in this pandemic.

Skiing and other gatherings: advice to governments

There are over 1000 ski resorts across the European Region. Eleven months into the pandemic, we know that ski resorts played a significant role in seeding the pandemic across Europe and that social gatherings were key in its resurgence during and after the summer.

Skiing does not spread COVID-19, but busy mountain resorts do. During the upcoming holidays, WHO recommends that countries carefully consider adapting the setup of seasonal activities to remove the possibility of crowding, especially in confined or closed settings, including during travel.

WHO offers this additional advice to countries for the winter.

Assess the winter gatherings that would normally happen, be they sporting, recreational or religious, and evaluate very carefully the risks associated with them. Authorities should consider postponing, limiting or cancelling mass gatherings in the current European transmission context.

Adjust and communicate decisions and any associated travel guidance early, based on how the virus is spreading domestically and internationally. Prevent those who have COVID-19 and their contacts from travelling.

Take measures to decongest public transport and key transportation hubs.

Celebrations, gatherings and travel: advice to individuals and communities

Despite risks, there are a few simple measures that individuals and communities can take to make the holidays and winter season as safe as possible.

On celebrations

Communities across the European Region are weighing whether or not to host religious processions, holiday markets and church celebrations. In countries experiencing widespread community transmission of the virus, postponing or reducing such gatherings should be seriously considered.

Regardless of location, religious services should take place differently this year. They should be held outdoors whenever possible or be limited in size and duration, with physical distancing, ventilation, hand hygiene and mask use, as appropriate.

On indoor gatherings

Indoor gatherings, even smaller ones, can be especially risky because they bring together groups of people, young and old, from different households, who may not all be adhering to the same infection prevention measures.

Gatherings should be held outside if possible, and participants should wear masks and maintain physical distancing. If held indoors, limiting group size and ensuring good ventilation to reduce exposure risk are key.

It may feel awkward to wear masks and practise physical distancing when around friends and family, but doing so contributes significantly to ensuring that everyone remains safe and healthy.

Vulnerable people and older friends or relatives may find it very difficult to ask loved ones to stay away physically, regardless of the anxieties or concerns they may have. Consider what others may be feeling and the difficult decisions they will be facing.

On travelling

For some people, travelling is the only way to visit families and friends. For those who are travelling, avoid any transportation that might be crowded.

Some countries require a negative test before granting access, and some others require quarantine. WHO encourages everyone to follow guidance from authorities when travelling.

While marking the holidays this year may look different, we can still make the most of it. We wish everyone a joyful and peaceful winter holiday season. Play it safe and stay healthy.",http://www.euro.who.int

73,"“Most of my missions stand out in some way or another due to the nature of helicopter operations. They often entail emergencies either on a mountain or in inaccessible terrain, or otherwise involve serious patterned injuries or time-critical medical conditions,” explains Jacqueline Zbären, a helicopter paramedic nurse working in the Bernese Highlands in Switzerland.

“Something that has made quite the impression on me is that major accidents can occur in the most unremarkable day-to-day activities, like biking or getting groceries, or else during a simple day trip in the mountains. Healthy individuals of any age can suddenly develop life-threatening diseases, like pulmonary embolisms and heart attacks, or trip and sustain major injuries,” adds the 37-year-old, who works at one of the 12 helicopter bases of Swiss Air-Rescue (Rega) distributed across the country.

“Having witnessed how someone’s life can change abruptly has increased my awareness of my own health and well-being.”

Time is of the essence

“The team in the helicopter is made up of a pilot, a doctor and a paramedic nurse, and the operations centre we’re in touch with over radio. When we receive the emergency notification, when the weather permits take-off, we have as little as 5 minutes to be ready to be airborne. During winter and summer tourist seasons, the base I work at is open 24/7 and shifts can last 24 or 48 hours.

“In primary missions, which are almost 90% of the operations of our helicopter base, we rescue or deliver the first medical assistance on the scene of an accident, while secondary missions involve relocating a patient from one health-care facility to another. In all our operations, the decisive factor is time.

“I’ve always known I wanted to work in the medical field, and I chose the nursing profession because it offered a wide variety of specialization options. The emergency setting fascinated me, which is why I specialized in anaesthesia after my 4-year nursing degree and then proceeded to a 2-year training to become a paramedic nurse. After working for 8 years in paramedicine, I switched to helicopter rescue operations about a year ago, after completing a Helicopter Emergency Medical Services Technical Crew member training.

“The biggest difference from working in a hospital is that in many hospital settings, you have several patients for whom you are responsible. As a paramedic nurse, you have only 1 or 2 to focus on, and while the care is limited in time, it is very intense.”

Managing the unpredictable

“The most defining elements of my work are its unpredictability and the diversity of my tasks. We can be requested to fly to the scene of a car accident, to rescue someone injured in the mountains or to transfer critical-care patients.

“I can be discussing expected medical needs with the emergency physician en route, but then the situation on the ground turns out to be entirely different. Or else, in rare cases, I am required to leave the doctor at a scene while the pilot and I must leave for another mission where I have full autonomy.

“In flight, I oversee medical, technical and operational tasks. I care for the patient’s well-being in close dialogue with the doctor, assist the pilot by operating the navigation devices and radio, and handle the hoist to lower down the doctor or a helicopter rescue specialist from the Swiss Alpine Club when we cannot land.

“I have to slip in and out of various roles and mindsets – I may be thinking of the medical equipment needed upon landing, then help the pilot reach our destination, and moments later think strategically about how best to transport the patient to the helicopter.

“We undergo continuous training to hone our medical, technical and operational skills and, above all, to be prepared for every eventuality.”",http://www.euro.who.int

WHO has designated 2020, the bicentenary of the birth of Florence Nightingale, the International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife.

Nurses and midwives work at all levels of health systems and across diverse settings and contexts delivering quality care, leading teams, conducting research, influencing and implementing policy, and educating the next generation of nurses and midwives.

Simply put, their role is critical to making universal health coverage a reality around the world.

Throughout the year, and including activities on and around World Health Day, WHO will work closely with partners to celebrate the contributions of nurses and midwives, highlight the challenges they often face, and advocate for planned investment in the nursing and midwifery workforce.

Strengthening nursing and midwifery in the WHO European Region

Nurses and midwives comprise a majority of health-care professionals in the Region and play a key role in the successful delivery of health- and social-care services. As the health needs of the Region change, nurses are becoming an increasingly important part of the response.

WHO/Europe provides support to countries across the Region for strengthening nursing and midwifery. Recommended actions for a strong nursing and midwifery workforce include:

raising nursing and midwifery education to the university level;

expanding the scope of nursing and midwifery practices;

preparing nurses for leadership roles in health-care systems;

creating pathways for career progression;

improving working conditions and salaries of nurses and midwives;

increasing nurses’ and midwives’ participation in decision-making at all levels of policy development and implementation;

developing effective workforce planning strategies; and

raising awareness in government and society of the importance of nurses’ and midwives’ work.

Appreciation and support for nurses and midwives

In 2020, events and activities will highlight the need to strengthen nursing and midwifery to achieve health for all and boost nursing and midwifery leadership.

The year-long focus on nurses and midwives is an opportunity to get involved and demonstrate broad public and political support for more health workers with the right skills and in the right locations to best meet people’s changing health- and social-care needs.",http://www.euro.who.int
75,"The winter holidays this year might be different from recent years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But the best gifts you can give are health, kindness and support.

76,"Law for Universal Health Coverage (UHC)

For all aspects of health, there are binding rules that govern the rights and responsibilities of governments, health workers, companies, civil society and a country’s population. Together these rules make up the legal framework, or legal architecture for health. They take many forms including: statutory laws, regulatory and administrative laws, contracts, case law, and customary laws. Who is involved in making these rules, and the form they take, differs from country to country.

Health laws are used to formalize commitment to goals, such as the goal of universal health coverage, creating a drive for action. To enable cooperation and achieve health goals, people use law to create different organizations (such as hospitals) and relationships (such as contracts for providing health services). In turn, organizations (whether health ministries, the private sector or civil society) have mandates, policies and strategies based on legal rules that guide their work.



There are also many rules that structure what health organizations and individuals should do, and what they may not do. This interaction between different health laws results in health system functions being carried out and health products and services being delivered.

77,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a virus transferred to humans from infected dromedary camels. It is a zoonotic virus, meaning it is transmitted between animals and people, and it is contractable through direct or indirect contact with infected animals. MERS-CoV has been identified in dromedaries in several countries in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. In total, 27 countries have reported cases since 2012, leading to 858 known deaths due to the infection and related complications.



The origins of the virus are not fully understood but according to the analysis of different virus genomes it is believed that it may have originated in bats and later transmitted to camels at some point in the distant past.



Human-to-human transmission is possible, but only a few such transmissions have been found among family members living in the same household. In health care settings, however, human-to-human transmission appears to be more frequent.",https://www.who.int/health-topics
78,"Mycetoma is a chronic, progressively destructive morbid inflammatory disease usually of the foot but any part of the body can be affected. Infection is most probably acquired by traumatic inoculation of certain fungi or ‎bacteria into the subcutaneous tissue. Mycetoma was described in the modern literature in 1694 but was first reported in the mid-19th century in the Indian town of Madura, and hence was initially called Madura foot.

Mycetoma commonly affects young adults, particularly males aged between 20 and 40 years, mostly in developing countries. People of low socioeconomic status and manual workers such as agriculturalists, labourers and herdsmen are the worst affected.

Mycetoma has numerous adverse medical, health and socioeconomic impacts on patients, communities and health authorities.

As mycetoma is a badly neglected disease, accurate data on its incidence and prevalence are not available.",https://www.who.int/health-topics

106,"The world is in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic. As WHO and partners work together on the response -- tracking the pandemic, advising on critical interventions, distributing vital medical supplies to those in need--- they are racing to develop and deploy safe and effective vaccines.

Vaccines save millions of lives each year. Vaccines work by training and preparing the body’s natural defences --- the immune system--- to recognize and fight off the viruses and bacteria they target. If the body is exposed to those disease-causing germs later, the body is immediately ready to destroy them, preventing illness.

There are currently more than 50 COVID-19 vaccine candidates in trials. WHO is working in collaboration with scientists, business, and global health organizations through the ACT Accelerator to speed up the pandemic response. When a safe and effective vaccine is found, COVAX (led by WHO, GAVI and CEPI) will facilitate the equitable access and distribution of these vaccines to protect people in all countries. People most at risk will be prioritized. While we work towards rolling out a safe and effective vaccine fairly, we must continue the essential public health actions to suppress transmission and reduce mortality.",https://who.int

108,"COVAX now has agreements in place to access nearly two billion doses of several promising vaccine candidates, and laid the groundwork for further doses to be secured through contributions from donors



These agreements mean that all COVAX’s 190 participating and eligible economies will be able to access doses to protect vulnerable groups in the first half of 2021. At least 1.3 billion donor-funded doses will be made available to 92 economies eligible for the Gavi COVAX AMC, targeting up to 20% population coverage by the end of the year.



Funding raised in 2020 and early pledges toward 2021 targets, alongside these agreements, offer clearest pathway yet to ending the acute phase of the pandemic globally by the end of 2021

Geneva/Oslo, 18 December 2020 – COVAX, the global initiative to ensure rapid and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for all countries, regardless of income level, today announced that it had arrangements in place to access nearly two billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine candidates, on behalf of 190 participating economies. For the vast majority of these deals, COVAX has guaranteed access to a portion of the first wave of production, followed by volume scales as further supply becomes available. The arrangements announced today will enable all participating economies to have access to doses in the first half of 2021, with first deliveries anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2021 – contingent upon regulatory approvals and countries’ readiness for delivery.

Given these are arrangements for 2 billion doses of vaccine candidates which are still under development, COVAX will continue developing its portfolio: this will be critical to achieve its goal of securing access to 2 billion doses of safe and effective, approved vaccines that are suitable for all participants’ contexts, and available by the end of 2021. However, today’s announcements offer the clearest pathway yet to end the acute phase of the pandemic by protecting the most vulnerable populations around the world. This includes delivering at least 1.3 billion donor-funded doses of approved vaccines in 2021 to the 92 low- and middle-income economies eligible for the COVAX AMC.

The new deals announced today include the signing of an advance purchase agreement with AstraZeneca for 170 million doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford candidate, and a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Johnson & Johnson for 500 million doses of the Janssen candidate, which is currently being investigated as a single dose vaccine.. These deals are in addition to existing agreements COVAX has with the Serum Institute of India (SII) for 200 million doses – with options for up to 900 million doses more – of either the AstraZeneca/Oxford or Novavax candidates, as well as a statement of intent for 200 million doses of the Sanofi/GSK vaccine candidate.

In addition to this, COVAX also has – through R&D partnership agreements – first right of refusal in 2021 to access potentially more than one billion doses (based on current estimates from the manufacturing processes under development) that will be produced, subject to technical success and regulatory approval, by candidates in the COVAX R&D Portfolio.

“This commitment is evidence that the world learned an important lesson from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Our research and development efforts have begun to pay off. We now have safe and effective vaccines that can protect against COVID-19 and a clear pathway to securing 2 billion doses for the populations at greatest risk all around the world,” said Dr Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). “Securing the right of first refusal of successful vaccine production as part of R&D arrangements has helped guarantee equitable access to vaccines, a founding principle of CEPI. The challenge of delivering the vaccines that have demonstrated success, of completing the development of other promising vaccine candidates to further increase supply, and of ending the acute phase of the pandemic, lies ahead of us.”

Alongside boosting its pathway to two billion doses of approved vaccines through direct agreements with manufacturers, the COVAX Facility has also opened another potential source of vaccines. Published today, the Principles for Dose-Sharing provide a framework for higher-income economies to make additional volumes secured via bilateral deals available through the Facility primarily to AMC participants, on an equitable basis. These principles outline that such doses must be safe and effective, available as early as possible and should be available in substantive volumes as early as possible in 2021 to enable rapid and flexible deployment by the Facility – supporting the overall goal of equitable access.

First deliveries in Q1 2021

Today’s announcements on deals and dose-sharing mean COVAX can plan for the first deliveries of vaccines in the first quarter of 2021, with the first tranche of doses – enough to protect health and social care workers – delivered in the first half of 2021 to all participating economies who have requested doses in this timeframe. This would be followed by further delivery of doses to all participants in the second half of the year – targeting supply of doses equalling up to 20% of participants’ populations (or a lower amount if requested by the participant) by the end of the year. Additional doses to reach higher coverage levels will then be available in 2022. All deliveries are contingent upon several factors, such as regulatory approvals and country readiness.

“The arrival of vaccines is giving all of us a glimpse of the light at the end of the tunnel,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO). “But we will only truly end the pandemic if we end it everywhere at the same time, which means it’s essential to vaccinate some people in all countries, rather than all people in some countries. And we must remember that vaccines will complement, but not replace, the many other tools we have in our toolbox to stop transmission and save lives. We must continue to use all of them.""

The COVAX Facility currently has 190 participating economies. This includes 98 higher-income economies and 92 low- and middle-income economies eligible to have their participation in the Facility supported via the financing mechanism known as the Gavi COVAX AMC. Of the 92 economies eligible to be supported by the COVAX AMC, 86 have now submitted detailed vaccine requests, offering the clearest picture yet on actual global demand for COVID-19 vaccines.

In addition to gathering detailed information on participating economies’ vaccine requests, COVAX, through Gavi, UNICEF, WHO, the World Bank, and other partners has been working closely with all countries in the Facility, particularly AMC-eligible participants, to help plan and prepare for the widespread roll out of vaccines. Conditions that determine country readiness include regulatory preparedness as well as the availability of infrastructure, appropriate legal frameworks, training, and capacity, among other factors.

“Securing access to doses of a new vaccine for both higher-income and lower-income countries, at roughly the same time and during a pandemic, is a feat the world has never achieved before – let alone at such unprecedented speed and scale,” said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which leads on procurement and delivery for COVAX. “COVAX has now built a platform that offers the world the prospect, for the first time, of being able to defeat the pandemic on a global basis, but the work is not done: it’s critical that both governments and industry continue to support our efforts to achieve this goal”.

Early pledges towards 2021 fundraising targets

To achieve this ambitious goal, COVAX currently estimates it needs to raise an additional US$ 6.8 billion in 2021 – US$ 800 million for research and development, at least US$ 4.6 billion for the COVAX AMC and US$ 1.4 billion for delivery support.

Support for the COVAX AMC will be critical to ensuring ability to pay is not a barrier to access. Thanks to the generous support of sovereign, private sector, and philanthropic donors, the AMC has met its urgent 2020 fundraising target of US$ 2 billion, but at least US$ 4.6 billion more is needed in 2021 to procure doses of successful candidates as they come through the portfolio.

The last two weeks have seen a number of pledges made to Gavi for the COVAX AMC, bringing the overall amount raised to US$ 2.4 billion:



Norway has signed a new commitment of NOK 1 billion to the International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm), to be paid from 2021 to 2030. This funding will support the Gavi COVAX AMC and comes on top of earlier commitments of NOK 164.1 million in direct funding and $6.25 million in funding transferred from the PCV AMC to support the Gavi COVAX AMC.

This funding will support the Gavi COVAX AMC and comes on top of earlier commitments of NOK 164.1 million in direct funding and $6.25 million in funding transferred from the PCV AMC to support the Gavi COVAX AMC. Canada pledged CAD 75 million in funding to support the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines in lower income economies as part of the Gavi COVAX AMC. This includes a CAD 5 million investment in the development of a mechanism to equitably reallocate vaccine doses through the COVAX Facility, either by donation or exchange.

The goal of COVAX is to deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines that have passed regulatory approval and/or WHO prequalification by the end of 2021. These vaccines will be offered equally to all participating countries, proportional to their populations, initially prioritising healthcare workers then expanding to cover vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. Further doses will then be made available based on country need, vulnerability and COVID-19 threat. The COVAX Facility will also maintain a buffer of doses for emergency and humanitarian use.

Quotes from partners

Karina Gould, Minister of International Development, Government of Canada said: “We know that as long as one country is at risk, we are all at risk. The COVAX Facility is the key to ending this pandemic and will only work if we all come together. Now is the time to make our commitment to equitable access a reality, so that everyone, everywhere has access to a life-saving vaccine.”

Dr Kwaku Agyeman Manu, Minister of Health for Ghana said: The nearly 2 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses announced today by COVAX is a welcome first step, but our journey is not yet over. As we’ve learned with routine immunisation vaccines don’t save lives, vaccination does. This means we need the health infrastructure in place - from supply chain and logistics to well- trained health workers - to ensure the effective and streamlined distribution of vaccines. For this we call on governments, manufacturers and the private sector to make urgent and necessary investments in COVAX so that no one is left behind; because ultimately no one is safe until everyone is safe.

Dag-Inge Ulstein, Norway’s Minister of International Development and Co-chair of the ACT-A Facilitation Council, said: “The good news is that many countries, foundations and some private companies have already provided support to this important collective effort. The bad news is that more is needed. We need to look beyond the health sector and the international development sector if we are to find the political and financial resources required to combat the pandemic and its many different impacts.”

Wendy Morton, Minister for Global Health at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office of the UK, which also hosted the Global Vaccine Summit in June, said: “The UK has played the leading role in championing global access to coronavirus vaccines, including by being the largest donor to the COVAX Advance Market Commitment. No one is safe until we are all safe. Along with our international partners, the UK is working hard to ensure vaccines get to everyone who needs them.”

Dr John Nkengasong, Director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) said: “Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Africa CDC has established several trusted partnerships across the globe. The COVAX partnership is one of such very critical alliances that will allow Africa to secure early access to COVID-19 vaccine needed to start vaccinating our populations across the continent.”

Henrietta Fore, Executive Director of UNICEF said: “This is an unprecedented undertaking — addressing a global pandemic while ensuring we do not leave the world’s poorest behind. UNICEF is bringing the full weight of our experience as the world’s largest single procurer of vaccines to help secure and deliver COVID-19 vaccines, and help countries prepare to receive and administer them.”

Dr Ngozi-Okonjo Iweala, co-chair of the COVAX Coordination Meeting and Gavi Board Chair said: “Nine months ago, it was hard to imagine that we would have more than one promising vaccine candidate and be in a position to make them available to both high-income countries and lower-income countries simultaneously. The global community has rallied, and we now have a platform, COVAX, that will do this. It’s time to stop questioning it and give it the support it needs to bring the pandemic to an end as swiftly as possible.”

Jane Halton, co-chair of the COVAX Coordination Meeting and Chair of CEPI said: “Science will give us the tools to fight this pandemic, but equitable access will allow us to beat it. Today marks a significant moment towards our goal of fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for those most at risk around the world. We now have a clear pathway to our goal of delivering 2 billion doses of vaccine in 2021 - enabled by COVAX R&D investments and deals with manufacturers - which can bring an end to the acute phase of the pandemic globally. In addition, governments can now demonstrate their continued commitment to this goal by contributing doses to COVAX of vaccines secured through bilateral deals. Equitable access to vaccines is in all of our interests, and we’re now a significant step closer to making this a reality.”

Mesfin Teklu Tessema, civil society representative of the COVAX Coordination Meeting and Senior Director, Head of Health Unit, International Rescue Committee said: ""The COVAX Facility is our best hope to ending this pandemic as quickly as possible with equity as its grounding force. This announcement today is an important milestone and proof that doses are forthcoming to those most in need everywhere.""

Adar Poonawalla, CEO of the Serum Institute of India (SII) said: ""We are delighted to announce that we have signed for a 100mn doses of Novavax and another 100mn doses of AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccines with COVAX, with an option of extending it by 900mn doses. The advance purchase commitments under COVAX initiative is encouraging as it will further bolster our fight and ensure equitable access at the most affordable price from Serum Institute of India.”

Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, AstraZeneca, said: “Today’s Agreement is a significant milestone for global access to the AZD1222 vaccine. Our collaboration with COVAX is testament to AstraZeneca’s commitment to broad, equitable access at no profit during the pandemic period. We now look forward to progressing our work with COVAX partners to ensure that as many people as possible around the world can access a safe, effective vaccine – wherever they live.”

Paul Stoffels, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson said: “Since we initiated development of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, Johnson & Johnson has remained committed to ensuring access to vaccines on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use. Equitable global access, inclusive of lower income countries, is critical to helping end the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Thomas B. Cueni, Director General, International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (IFPMA) said: The reason why we can mark today as a milestone for COVAX securing 2 billion doses of promising vaccines is because the vaccine makers have pulled out all the stops and have delivered beyond all expectations. So let’s indeed mark this important milestone in ensuring fair and equitable access to vaccines which we have committed to from the outset of the pandemic. But let us also remember, that we would not be where we are if science and the innovation ecosystem that allows the biopharmaceutical to develop and manufacture life saving treatments had not risen to the challenge, so that there are different types of vaccines that will be manufactured in historic quantities. Looking to 2021, it is essential that all COVAX partners and governments focus on getting things done and secure the funds need.

Notes to editors

The full list of deals that have so far been secured by COVAX on behalf of the Facility is as follows:

170 million doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford candidate, via an advance purchase agreement between Gavi and AstraZeneca, and enabled by a partnership agreement with CEPI to fund scale-out of manufacturing

About COVAX

COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by CEPI, Gavi and WHO – working in partnership with developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers, UNICEF, the World Bank, and others. It is the only global initiative that is working with governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries.

CEPI is leading on the COVAX vaccine research and development portfolio, investing in R&D across a variety of promising candidates, with the goal to support development of three safe and effective vaccines which can be made available to countries participating in the COVAX Facility. As part of this work, CEPI has secured first right of refusal to potentially over one billion doses for the COVAX Facility to a number of candidates, and made strategic investments in vaccine manufacturing, which includes reserving capacity to manufacture doses of COVAX vaccines at a network of facilities, and securing glass vials to hold 2 billion doses of vaccine. CEPI is also investing in the ‘next generation’ of vaccine candidates, which will give the world additional options to control COVID-19 in the future.

Gavi is leading on procurement and delivery for COVAX, coordinating the design and implementation of the COVAX Facility and the COVAX AMC and working with Alliance partners UNICEF and WHO, along with governments, on country readiness and delivery. The COVAX Facility is the global pooled procurement mechanism for COVID-19 vaccines through which COVAX will ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines for all 190 participating economies, using an allocation framework formulated by WHO. The COVAX Facility will do this by pooling buying power from participating economies and providing volume guarantees across a range of promising vaccine candidates. The Gavi COVAX AMC is the financing mechanism that will support the participation of 92 low- and middle-income countries in the Facility, enabling access to donor-funded doses of safe and effective vaccines. UNICEF and the Pan-American Health Organisation (PAHO) will be acting as procurement coordinators for the COVAX Facility, helping deliver vaccines to all participants.

WHO has multiple roles within the COVAX: among other things it supports countries as they prepare to receive and administer vaccines and does so in partnership with UNICEF. It provides normative guidance on vaccine policy, regulation, safety, R&D, allocation, and country readiness and delivery. Its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization develops evidence-based immunization policy recommendations. Its Emergency Use Listing (EUL)/prequalification programmes ensure harmonized review and authorization across member states. It provides global coordination and member state support on vaccine safety monitoring. It developed the target product profiles for COVID-19 vaccines and provides R&D technical coordination. Along with COVAX partners, it is developing a no-fault compensation scheme for indemnification and liability issues. COVAX is part of the Act accelerator which WHO launched with partners in 2020.

109,"The World Health Organization and YouTube have partnered on an inviting and humorous public service announcement (PSA) to help battle COVID-19 fatigue as we head into the holiday season. After nine months of physical distancing, lockdowns and other preventative measures, the video reminds viewers to stay vigilant and continue to take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus as people in many parts of the world head into the holiday season.



Voiced by actor and comedian Jon Glaser (Parks and Rec, Bob’s Burgers, Girls) the short animated video reinforces the WHO’s recommendations that viewers should stay home when possible, wear a mask if they need to go out, wash their hands and stay away from others when in public.



The PSA also gives advice for how to tackle some of the common holiday activities that could lead to further spread of COVID-19, including travel (think twice!), large gatherings (turn around and head home!) and visiting with high-risk relatives (try a video call!).



The PSA is available on YouTube starting today and will be promoted through early January as a pre-roll ad, in features on the YouTube homepage, and in posts from YouTube’s social media handles.

110,"Lack of water puts health care workers and patients at higher risk of COVID-19 infection

Around 1.8 billion people are at heightened risk of COVID-19 and other diseases because they use or work in health care facilities without basic water services, warn WHO and UNICEF.

“Working in a health care facility without water, sanitation and hygiene is akin to sending nurses and doctors to work without personal protective equipment” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Water supply, sanitation and hygiene in health care facilities are fundamental to stopping COVID-19. But there are still major gaps to overcome, particularly in least developed countries.”

The report, Fundamentals first: Universal water, sanitation, and hygiene services in health care facilities for safe, quality care, comes as COVID-19 is exposing key vulnerabilities within health systems, including inadequate infection prevention and control.

Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) are vital to the safety of health workers and patients yet provision of these services is not prioritized. Worldwide, 1 in 4 health care facilities has no water services, 1 in 3 does not have access to hand hygiene where care is provided, 1 in 10 has no sanitation services*, and 1 in 3 does not segregate waste safely.

“Sending healthcare workers and people in need of treatment to facilities without clean water, safe toilets, or even soap puts their lives at risk,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “This was certainly true before the COVID-19 pandemic, but this year has made these disparities impossible to ignore. As we reimagine and shape a post-COVID world, making sure we are sending children and mothers to places of care equipped with adequate water, sanitation and hygiene services is not merely something we can and should do. It is an absolute must.”

The situation is worst of all in the world’s 47 Least Developed Countries (LDCs): 1 in 2 health care facilities does not have basic drinking water, 1 in 4 health care facilities has no hand hygiene facilities at points of care; and 3 in 5 lack basic sanitation services.

But this can be fixed. The report’s preliminary estimates indicate that it would cost roughly USD 1 per capita to enable all 47 LDCs to establish basic water service in health facilities. On average, USD 0.20 per capita is needed each year to operate and maintain services.

According to the report, immediate, incremental investments in WASH have big returns: improving hygiene in health care facilities is a “best buy” for tackling antimicrobial resistance. It reduces health care costs because it reduces health-care associated infections (which are costly to treat). It saves time as health workers do not have to search for water for hand hygiene. Better hygiene also increases uptake of services. This all adds up to a return of USD 1.5 for every dollar invested.

These services are especially critical for vulnerable populations, including pregnant mothers, newborns and children. Improving WASH services in health care facilities is particularly important around childbirth when far too many mothers and newborns suffer and die, including from preventable conditions like sepsis. Better WASH services could save a million pregnant women and newborns’ lives and reduce still-births.

The report provides four main recommendations:

Implement costed national roadmaps with appropriate financing;

Monitor and regularly review progress in improving WASH services, practices and the enabling environment;

Develop capacities of health workforce to sustain WASH services and promote and practice good hygiene;

Integrate WASH into regular health sector planning, budgeting, and programming, including COVID-19 response and recovery efforts to deliver quality services.

Global WASH and health partners have shown their support for meeting global and country WASH in health care facility targets. By 2020, over 130 partners have committed resources, of which 34 have made dedicated financial commitments totalling USD125 million.

Nevertheless, implementation of the 2019 World Health Assembly Resolution on WASH in health care facilities is uneven. Of the nearly 50 countries for which WHO and UNICEF have data, 86 per cent have updated standards and 70 per cent have conducted initial assessments which show that these areas are generally on track. Yet just a third of countries have costed national WASH in health care facility roadmaps and only 10 per cent have included WASH indicators in national health systems monitoring.

More catalytic global funding, technical support, and domestic resourcing is needed to keep health care workers and patients safe and protected. Now, an opportunity exists to build on existing efforts and commitments and integrate WASH in health care facilities in all national COVID-19 plans, vaccine distribution and economic recovery packages.

“For millions of healthcare workers across the world, water is PPE”, said Jennifer Sara, Global Director for Water at the World Bank Group. “It is essential that financing keeps flowing to bring water and sanitation services to those battling the COVID crisis on the frontlines. Funding WASH in healthcare facilities is among the most cost-effective investments that governments can make.”

Data published by WHO in October indicates that COVID-19 infections among health care workers are far greater than those in the general population: Health care workers represent less than 3 per cent of the population, but account for 14 per cent of global COVID-19 cases reported to WHO. Ensuring health care workers have the basic WASH necessities to keep themselves, their patients, their families and children safe - is imperative.

“Millions have no option but to seek care from the 50% of health care facilities in the developing world which don’t have clean water on the premises. This cannot continue. Every day both healthcare workers’ and patients’ lives are being put at risk,” saidTim Wainwright, Chief Executive at international charity WaterAid. “Without frontline health workers being able to wash their hands; provide their patients with clean water; or have somewhere decent to go to the toilet, a hospital is not a hospital at all - it’s a breeding ground for disease.”

Note to Editors:

The data in this year’s report include statistics for 165 countries, from surveys representing 760,000 facilities. Compared to last year’s baseline report, estimates were available for 125 countries with data from surveys representing 560,000 facilities. The data on county progress in implementing the World Health Assembly Resolution represent 47 countries. It is the first time these data have been compiled and analyzed.

Sanitation services are measures taken to ensure the hygienic management of excreta along all stages of the sanitation chain: capture, containment, emptying, transport, treatment and safe disposal.

111,"Funding for community programmes, engaging youth in solutions to address COVID-19, and convening Global Youth Summit are key features of this new mobilization



A new ground-breaking global youth mobilization was launched today to invest in and scale up youth-led solutions and engagements in response to COVID-19. The initiative was launched by an alliance of the world’s largest youth movements and organizations, together with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Foundation.



The “Global Youth Mobilization for Generation Disrupted” is being led by the Big 6 Youth Organizations (Young Men’s Christian Association, YMCA; World Young Women’s Christian Association, YWCA; World Organization of the Scout Movement; World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts; International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, IFRC; and The Duke of Edinburgh’s International Award), which together actively involve more than 250 million young people, and aims to support young people to engage in and design efforts to turn around the impact of the pandemic.



The Global Youth Mobilization will feature the convening of a Global Youth Summit in April 2021, and a fund of US $5 million to support local and national youth organizations, including grants for youth-led solutions and an accelerator programme to scale up existing response efforts.



The leadership of the WHO, Big 6 and youth organizations around the world are calling on governments, businesses and policy makers to back the Global Youth Mobilization effort and commit to investing in the future of young people. These measures will directly support young people engaged at the grassroots level to tackle some of the most pressing health and societal challenges resulting from the pandemic.



“WHO is honoured to join this truly exciting and powerful global movement to mobilize and empower youth worldwide to be the driving force of the recovery to COVID-19,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Joining forces with the Big 6 and the United Nations Foundation provides WHO and the world a unique opportunity to learn from hundreds of millions of young people and be guided by their sustainable solutions to help communities build back better from the pandemic.”

While the direct health impacts of the pandemic on young people have been generally less severe, they are disproportionately affected by the long-lasting consequences of the pandemic. Such effects include disruptions to education, economic uncertainty, loss or lack of employment opportunities, impacts on physical and mental health, and trauma from domestic violence. For example, mental anxiety brought on by COVID-19 has been identified in nearly 90 per cent of young people; more than 1 billion students in almost every country have been impacted by school closures; and 1 in 6 young people worldwide have lost their jobs during the pandemic.



At the same time, young people are also driving change and implementing solutions in response to COVID-19 by taking action through community-based interventions and voluntary service, such as acting as first responders and delivering food and supplies to those in need. The Global Youth Mobilization will draw attention to the urgent need for solutions to support young people, and to highlight the critical leadership role young people are playing in their communities to counter the effects of the pandemic.



“We are proud to team up with the WHO to provide opportunities and funding to help millions of young people across the globe to respond to local challenges related to COVID-19 in their communities,” said the leadership of the Big 6 in a joint statement. “The mobilization will provide direct financial and programmatic support to youth organizations at the national and international level. We believe that young people have the solutions to solve their own problems, and by providing a global youth platform, combined with national activation for youth projects, we can unleash the skills, enthusiasm and desire for young people to be a force for good in their communities.”



Supported by the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for WHO and powered by the United Nations Foundation, the Global Youth Mobilization features a strategic partnership with the WHO and its newly launched Youth Council. It will involve other United Nations agencies, as well as a number of high-profile global partners, brands, and advocates, from FIFA to YOUNGA by BridgingTheGap Ventures, and the creation of a youth council of social media influencers, including the Influential platform. The initiative, developed in consultation with young people from across the globe, will be youth-led, community-driven, evidence-based, and inclusive of diverse communities rooted in meaningful youth participation and engagement.

112,"2020 was a devastating year for global health. A previously unknown virus raced around the world, rapidly emerging as one of its top killers, laying bare the inadequacies of health systems. Today, health services in all regions are struggling to both tackle COVID-19, and provide people with vital care.



In another blow, the pandemic threatens to set back hard-won global health progress achieved over the past two decades - in fighting infectious diseases, for example, and improving maternal and child health.



So in 2021, countries around the world will need to continue battle COVID-19 (albeit with the knowledge that effective tools are evolving). They will need to move swiftly to repair and reinforce their health systems so they can deliver these tools, and to address the key societal and environmental issues that result in some sections of the population suffering so much more than others.

WHO and its partners will be at their side. We will work to help countries strengthen preparedness for pandemics and other emergencies. We will remind them of the importance of bringing countries together and of involving the whole government, not just the health sector. And we will support them in building strong health systems and healthy populations

Here are 10 ways we will do this:",https://who.int

115,"Scope and purpose

The World Health Organization (WHO) envisions a world where every pregnant woman and newborn receives quality care throughout the pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period. The importance of nutrition has been recognized as part of this care and a Comprehensive implementation plan on maternal, infant and young child nutrition has been approved by the 65th World Health Assembly.

As part of its unique normative function in health, WHO recommendations on antenatal care for a positive pregnancy experience were developed, which included 14 recommendations related to nutrition. These guidelines were developed in 2016 and are relevant to all pregnant women and adolescent girls receiving antenatal care in any health-care facility or community-based setting. In 2017, the Executive Guideline Steering Group (GSG) on WHO maternal and perinatal health recommendations prioritized the updating of four out of the 14 nutrition recommendations: calcium supplementation, zinc supplementation, vitamin D supplementation and multiple micronutrient supplementation. Updated guidance on calcium supplementation was published in 2018 [1] , while multiple micronutrient and vitamin D supplementation was published in 2020. [2] [3] We are currently updating guidance on the use of zinc supplementation during pregnancy.



Updated evidence reviews have been conducted for zinc supplementation and will be discussed during this guideline development panel meeting by videoconference, using Zoom, on 13 January 2021.



The main objectives of this panel meeting are to:



Present the evidence for informing the update of the recommendation for the WHO antenatal care guidelines for Zinc supplementation;

Draft updated recommendations for the Zinc recommendation, considering benefits, harms, values and preferences, feasibility, equity, ethics, acceptability, resource requirements and other factors, as appropriate;

Define implications for further research and gaps; and

Discuss considerations for the implementation of the recommendations, if necessary.

123,"The Ministry of Health, Kenya, has embarked on a new, robust approach to evaluate evidence for informing the next National Strategic Plan on Tuberculosis, Leprosy and Lung Health (2019-2023). A workshop, convened from April 17- 19 2017, reviewed consolidated national data and incorporated the extensive evidence base of critical studies and surveys on the TB situation. This was done to identify root causes of the epidemic, establish priorities and map out future actions.

Supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Global Fund, the government of Japan and WHO, the workshop brought together over 50 participants including experts from the national TB programme at both national and county level and international partners including, AMREF, USCDC, Centre for Health Solutions, FIND, Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), KIT, Stop TB Partnership, and the US Agency for International Development (USAID).

“Kenya must step up the effort to end TB,” said Dr Maureen Kamene, the head of National TB Programme, Ministry of Health, Kenya.

“Strong country-based evidence is the foundation for an effective national TB strategy for ending the TB epidemic. With this in focus, we have been generating much valuable evidence on the burden of TB and the response. This workshop is a critical first step to review all available evidence and formulate strong national policies for bold actions to end TB in Kenya.”

“We highly appreciate this evidence-based, participatory planning process for stronger TB response”, said Mr John Ochero, Senior Fund Portfolio Manager, Global Fund fight against AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis.

“We very much look forward to supporting Kenya’s efforts to implement bold strategies to end TB,” he added.

The workshop comes on the heels of the recent TB prevalence survey which highlighted major gaps in access to care, with more than half of people with TB disease undiagnosed or not notified. Also, the recent TB patient cost survey confirmed that the financial hardship is one of the major barriers to care and an episode of TB drives patients and families further deep into the poverty. Patient-pathway analysis identified gaps in the alignment of services with where people seek care. Addressing the gaps and barriers to ensure access to quality TB services by all people is therefore a key focus of the Kenya’s new national TB strategic plan.

“Kenya has made significant progress towards ending TB, but still faces a high burden of the disease,” emphasised Dr Rudi Eggers, WHO Representative for Kenya. To address these, WHO is supporting the country to develop a highly prioritized TB strategic plan through an approach that focuses on where people with TB may be ‘missing’ from care”.

The workshop was followed by partners’ coordination meeting on 20 April where all national and international partners come together to share their experiences and plans to support Kenya’s national TB response. It focused on the effective and swift implementation of the Global Fund’s Strategic Initiative on finding missing people with TB.

“We applaud the leadership of the national TB programme of Kenya in coordinating the efforts of all national and international partners”, said Dr Miriam Faid, Technical Officer, Stop TB Partnership.

“By aligning with the priorities of the national TB programme, we can achieve maximum synergy that lead to the impact. We are ready to continue to provide our support to Kenya’s national effort to end TB”.

The National Strategic Plan is expected to be finalized in September 2018. Consultative meetings with country stakeholders including county governments, civil society organizations and patient organizations will be conducted in May and June 2018.",https://www.afro.who.int

“Thanks to the World Health Organization, the mobile medical service in Mayom County has given us a breath as the service has been brought to our village hence we do not have to walk 3-5 kilometers to access health services”.

“She was experiencing severe pain when she came in”, says Dr Amos Bobble, a doctor with the WHO mobile medical team. She was treated at the WHO mobile clinic established in Mayom County, in the Greater Unity Region.

When she was leaving the clinic Ms Nyapiny Ter said: “now I am going to get better because of what the doctor has given me”.

Devastating floods leave nearly a million people in humanitarian crisis

“Relentless rain and flooding in many parts of South Sudan has left nearly one million people facing a humanitarian crisis”, said Dr Otim Patrick C. Ramadan, the WHO Incident Manager for the flood response.

In September 2019, Mayom County experienced heavy rainfall which was exacerbated by rivers bursting their banks causing significant flooding in the county. This caused destruction resulting in the death of livestock, submerging huts and displacement of people and animals.

Although the actual number of people displaced by the flood is not known an estimated 8 233 households and 50 621 individuals were displaced due to floods.

Water born disease such as malaria, diarrhoea, respiratory tract infections and dermatological conditions increased significantly. Women, girls, boys and men had to walk in the water for 3-5 kilometers to access health care services.

Following the Interagency Rapid Needs Assessment conducted in October 2019, WHO and health cluster partners dispatched medical supplies to support the communities affected by the flood.

The WHO mobile medical team supported the County Health Department and health cluster partner to respond to the increasing cases of acute watery diarrhoea, malaria and other diseases.

“Thanks to the South Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SSHF), WHO deployed mobile medical team along with 243 cartons of essential medicines and established mobile clinic close to the communities”, says Dr Olushayo Olu, WHO Representative in South Sudan.

Medical services are now taken close to the communities through mobile clinics and reduced preventable disabilities and death. Women, men, girls, and boys no longer walk 3-5 kilometers in the water to access health care services.

Mayom County is now better prepared to detect and respond to any outbreak. So far the mobile medical team have provided life-saving medical services to over 1 000 individuals.

WHO, in collaboration with health cluster partners is stepping up support to South Sudan’s flood-affected communities.

132,"Brazzaville – COVID-19 cases in the African region have risen steadily over the past two months, underscoring the need for reinforced public health measures to avert a surge in infections, particularly as people gather or travel for end-of-year celebrations.

Since mid-October, an average of 46 000 cases per week have been recorded in the 47 countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) African region compared with about 29 000 cases per week between early September and early October. Ten countries in the region have reported the highest number of cases, accounting for 88% of new cases in the past month. However, seven countries have recorded a steady decline in cases over the past four weeks.

Increased movement and interactions as well as slack observance of public health measures such as physical distancing and wearing of masks are some of the factors behind the upsurge in cases. Gatherings such as political rallies or in close settings have also contributed to the rise in infections.

“The rising COVID-19 infections and the holiday season present a worrying mix,” said Dr Richard Mihigo, the Immunization and Vaccine Development Programme Coordinator at WHO Regional Office for Africa. “Preventive measures must be tightened up to not only limit the risks of infections during the festive season but stand as permanent barriers against the spread of COVID-19. Complacency has no place in the fight against this pandemic.”

While many countries have improved COVID-19 response, including diagnosis, testing remains low across the region. In the past four weeks, only eight countries surpassed the critical benchmark of carrying out at least 10 tests per 10 000 population per week. Testing is crucial to understanding the pandemic trend and guiding response.

Over the recent months, lockdowns and movement restrictions instituted by many governments in the region have been eased. To strengthen COVID-19 response as cases are reported in many locations, WHO is urging countries to carry out assessments at the subnational level and identify high-risk areas so that local governments can adjust their public health measures accordingly and be agile in their decision-making.

“Trying to revive economies and livelihoods devastated by the pandemic while striving to limit the spread of COVID-19 is a very tough balancing act,” said Dr Nsenga Ngoy, the Emergency Response Programme Manager at WHO Regional Office for Africa. “But we cannot emphasize enough how important it is not to let our guard down. The likelihood of an increase in cases in the coming weeks can be averted by doubling down our efforts.”

WHO continues to support countries to maintain strong public health measures, decentralize response and step up preparedness for the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines as soon as they become available.

Dr Mihigo and Dr Ngoy spoke today at a press conference by WHO. They were joined by Mr Thabani Maphosa, Managing Director of Country Programmes, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.",https://www.afro.who.int
133,"Brazzaville – As African countries gear up for COVID-19 vaccination, the World Health Organization (WHO) calls for increased collaboration with communities to enhance the uptake of vaccines once they become available.

A 10-point vaccine readiness assessment tool for the 47 countries in WHO African Region finds that progress by countries in bolstering community engagement is only at 12%, far below the optimal score of at least 80%. Community engagement – a crucial aspect for vaccine uptake – is among the least advanced categories in the assessment tool.

Other key areas of the assessment tool are: planning and coordination, resource mobilization, vaccine regulation, service delivery, training and supervision, monitoring and evaluation, vaccine logistics, vaccine safety and surveillance.

“The success of any immunization campaign hinges on communities’ trust and acceptance. It is vital that we equip them with the right information, allay any fears and address concerns,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.

Engaging communities increases the likelihood that they will take the lead on issues affecting them, eases access and use of services. It also facilitates comprehension and access to information, enables feedback and, critically for COVID-19 vaccination, helps in understanding vaccine safety and addressing possible adverse events following immunization.

“Vaccines are our best hope of ending this pandemic. While all the efforts being made for successful immunization campaigns are critical, without community support they can easily flounder,” said Dr Moeti.

When COVID-19 vaccines become available, it is expected that they will be provided first to the most vulnerable and those at the highest risk. Initial groups will likely include frontline health workers, older people and adults with underlying conditions such heart disease or diabetes.

The initial COVID-19 vaccine supplies will be limited, as such will not be available to everyone right away. WHO and other immunization partners are providing technical support to countries in the African region to prepare for a successful COVID-19 vaccination rollout. Through the COVAX Facility, WHO and partners are working with governments and vaccine manufacturers to procure COVID-19 vaccine doses to cover 20% of the African population, initially focusing on those at the highest risk.",https://www.afro.who.int
134,"Brazzaville - The World Health Organization (WHO) today launched a new alliance, the Africa Infodemic Response Alliance (AIRA), to coordinate actions and pool resources in combating misinformation around COVID-19 pandemic and other health emergencies in Africa.

Digital platforms have been inundated with COVID-19-related information since the pandemic began in late 2019. Information about the virus has been shared and viewed over 270 billion times online and mentioned almost 40 million times on Twitter and web-based news sites in the 47 countries of the WHO African Region between February and November 2020, according to UN Global Pulse, the United Nations’ Secretary-General’s initiative on big data and artificial intelligence.

A large proportion of this information is inaccurate and misleading and continues to be shared by social media users intentionally or unknowingly every day. The COVID-19 infodemic is amplified online through social media but health misinformation is also circulating offline.

Measuring precisely how much of what is circulating is misinformation is difficult, but fact-checking organizations in Africa say they have debunked more than 1000 of such misleading reports since the onset of the pandemic. Some of the widely shared misinformation include conspiracies around unproven treatments, false cures and anti-vaccine messages.

“In health emergencies, misinformation can kill and ensure diseases continue to spread. People need proven, science-based facts to make informed decisions about their health and wellbeing, and a glut of information – an infodemic – with misinformation in the mix makes it hard to know what is right and real. This crucial new alliance brings unique reach, knowledge and skills to help stop the impact of dangerous misinformation,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.

Among others, the Africa Infodemic Response Alliance will work collaboratively to counter false information around COVID-19 vaccines and complement on the ground public health awareness raising and community engagement efforts by creating demand for vaccines in the region.

The network is the first initiative of its kind and it brings together 13 international and regional organizations and fact-checking groups with expertise in data and behavioural science, epidemiology, research, digital health, and communications to detect, disrupt and counter damaging misinformation on public health issues in Africa.

The Alliance will encourage proactive disclosure by data holders and support journalists and media outlets to effectively share lifesaving information based on scientific evidence and debunk disinformation on health issues.

It also aims to support individual African countries in developing tailored infodemic management strategies, including analysing trends and behaviours, recruiting specialists and refining systematic engagement strategies rooted in research and analytics.

This initiative puts into practice key recommendations on infodemic management that were developed by over 1300 experts from across disciplines in early 2020 under the auspices of WHO’s global Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN).

The Alliance members are Africa CDC, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the United Nations Verified initiative, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and United Nations Global Pulse. Participating and supporting bodies include Africa Check, Agence France-Presse Fact Check, PesaCheck, Dubawa and Meedan.

135,"On 14 February 2020, Africa confirmed its first COVID-19 case in Egypt. Since then, more than 1 million cases have been reported and every country on the continent has been affected. African governments were quick to adopt public health measures in line with WHO guidelines and instituted other restrictions such as lockdowns and curfews. While most countries have been spared the exponential growth witnessed in other regions, these measures have come at a heavy social and economic cost and as countries have started to open their borders, some have started to see cases rise.

WHO is coordinating the regional response, providing advice on critical preparedness, readiness and response measures for COVID-19 as well as diagnostics, surveillance, treatment and community engagement.",https://www.afro.who.int
136,"In early November 2020, positive samples for yellow fever were reported from five Nigerian states. Nigeria is a high-risk country for yellow fever and is a priority country for the global eliminate yellow fever epidemics (EYE) strategy. The re-emergence of the virus there in September 2017 has been marked by outbreaks throughout the country.

The county has taken great strides toward boosting yellow fever protection and has vaccinated approximately 70 million people through reactive and preventive activities since 2017. However, with COVID-19 response efforts underway, the country’s health system and human resources are being strained, making the response a challenge.

The World Health Organization (WHO) is supporting Nigeria to respond to the outbreak. As of 3 December and since the beginning of the outbreak, a total of 530 suspected and 48 confirmed cases have been reported by the country’s Centre for Disease Control, with 172 deaths among suspected cases, across the five affected states. Sample testing is ongoing at the national reference laboratories in the country.

Yellow fever is caused by a virus spread through the bite of infected mosquitos of the Aedes and Haemogogus species. The Aedes aegypti type of mosquito bites during the day. People who are infected can develop serious symptoms, including high fever, loss of appetite, nausea, muscle pains, headache, convulsion and jaundice. Some die from the complications of internal bleeding and organ failure.

With the onset of the current outbreak, epidemiologists and other health professionals have been deployed in each of the affected states. Outbreak investigation is ongoing through Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) under the coordination of respective State Ministries of Health. Workers at selected hospitals in each of the five affected state have been trained and provided with supplies to treat yellow fever patients.

Dr Onyinye Emefiene, WHO National Surveillance Officer/State Coordinator, is leading one of the teams responding to the outbreak in Delta State.

“When I got wind of the outbreak, the first response was to immediately set out with the Rapid Response Team to investigate the outbreak very early on a Saturday morning,” Dr Emefiene said. “Since then, it has been a marathon to ensure that active search for suspected cases is done, cases are appropriately managed and reactive vaccination commenced. Even though the reactive vaccination in the affected areas have been concluded, the battle continues to contain and control yellow fever epidemics in Delta State and beyond by strengthening our surveillance system and delivering potent vaccines to all eligible persons in the state.”

An accelerated preventive yellow fever mass vaccination campaign commenced in the other local government areas in Delta State the first week of December 2020. Meanwhile, a sensitization campaign is being implemented in the affected communities on avoiding daytime mosquito bites, keeping home surroundings clean and clearing mosquito breeding areas.

Infection with the yellow fever virus is easily prevented by a vaccine that provides immunity for life. Large epidemics of yellow fever occur when infected people introduce the virus into heavily populated areas with high mosquito density and low coverage for yellow fever vaccine. In Delta State, for example, all cases have no history of yellow fever vaccination, including a one-year-old baby.

Simultaneous to the outbreak, COVID-19 response efforts in Nigeria have demanded an extraordinary amount of time and resources from the country’s health system while lockdowns, travel restrictions and other mitigations to slow the spread have severely disrupted access to core essential health services.

National and state authorities are currently focused on the COVID-19 pandemic response, limiting the human resources required to conduct investigations and response activities for the yellow fever outbreaks.

The relative proximity of Delta, Enugu, Benue and Ebonyi states with Lagos is an added concern because the introduction of yellow fever outbreaks in urban environment with a large unvaccinated population can lead to rapid amplification with associated severe impacts. Population movements that could contribute to spreading of the virus may have been reduced in the COVID-19 context. However, there is a lack of data on this, and the risk of spread should be monitored.

Speaking on the outbreak, Dr Walter Kazadi Mulombo, WHO Representative in Nigeria, says that the country is one of the high priority countries implementing the eliminate yellow fever epidemics (EYE) strategy. Launched in 2017, the strategy involves more than 50 partners supporting 40 at-risk countries in Africa and the Americas to prevent, detect, and respond to yellow fever cases and outbreaks.

The partnership aims to protect at-risk populations, prevent international spread of the virus, and rapidly contain yellow fever outbreaks. Through work undertaken as part of this strategy, by 2026 it is expected that more than 1 billion people will be protected against the disease. This strategy is being steered by WHO, Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, and United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).

This year, proactive vaccination campaigns were planned for most at-risk states in Nigeria, including Delta. In total, over 31 million people will be protected.

“As part of EYE strategy, Nigeria has developed a 10-year strategic plan for the elimination of yellow fever epidemics. Through this strategy, the country plans to vaccinate at least 80% of the target population in all states by 2026,” Dr Mulombo said.

Thirty-four countries in Africa and 13 countries in the Americas are either endemic for, or have regions that are endemic for, yellow fever. Prompt detection of yellow fever and rapid response through reactive vaccination campaigns are essential for controlling outbreaks. However, underreporting is a concern — the true number of cases is estimated to be 10 to 250 times what is now being reported.",https://www.afro.who.int
137,"Nairobi – For 60-year-old Gabriel Wahome, it is simple: “universal health coverage was a very good idea,” he says. “We were happy about it.”

Two years ago, the Kenyan government piloted a universal health coverage programme in four of its 47 counties, easing access to health services for millions of people. It has since added more than 200 community health units, with 7700 community health volunteers and over 700 health workers have been recruited. The first year of the pilot phase saw over 1.6 million more hospital visits recorded.

The abolition of all fees at local and secondary level [county referral] health facilities widely expanded access to health services in the four pilot counties that were selected because of a high prevalence of communicable and noncommunicable diseases, high population density, high maternal mortality, and high incidence of road traffic injuries.

“We would go to the hospital even for minor illnesses like a common cold,” says Wahome. “Life changed.”

In an assessment of the pilot phase, the Ministry of Health underscored the need for improvement in a range of areas including accelerated staff recruitment, better links between local and higher-level health facilities, timely funding and supply of medical commodities as well as coordination and management.

The government is now scaling up universal health coverage based on the experiences from the pilot phase and will focus on further reforming its national hospital insurance fund, establishing a mandatory universal health coverage scheme, adopting an essential package of health services, and providing health coverage for an initial 1 million low-income households to be biometrically registered.

“Without improved standards of health, our quest for prosperity and better life for our people would remain hollow,” President Uhuru Kenyatta said in October while launching the biometric registration for the universal health coverage scheme.

Investments made under the first phase of the universal health coverage have helped in the COVID-19 response, says Dr Nelson Muriu, the director of the County Health Department in Nyeri, a central Kenya region which was among the four pilot counties selected for the health coverage scheme.

More health personnel have been hired to help curb the spread of COVID-19, while intensive care units were expanded and more medical equipment procured, Dr Muriu says. The pandemic has exerted a huge strain in health systems across the region and disrupted the provision of essential health services.

The World Health Organization is supporting the government by providing technical assistance in key areas including health financing such as reforming the national hospital insurance fund, developing and using information on financial risk protection as well as supporting the establishing a digital health platform and a national health observatory.

Dr Rudi Eggers, WHO Representative in Kenya, notes that launching universal health coverage at the local level and funding health facilities are the key achievements of the pilot phase.

“We saw people access the services to a much greater extent than they had done before,” says Dr Eggers. “This tells me that there were people that avoided going to health facilities even though they need the services because they feared the financial cost of such a visit.”

Ensuring adequate health workforce, improving skills, health facility financing as well as subsidizing medical costs for low-income households and part-funding health insurance schemes are critical in sustaining universal health coverage, says Dr Eggers.

“With this foundation, Kenya’s UHC [universal health coverage] initiative can expand to ensure access to high-quality health services without financial concern for all Kenyans.”",https://www.afro.who.int
138,"Luanda – “COVID-19 doesn’t kill anybody in Angola as we are immune due to malaria,” so goes one of the myriad falsehoods about the pandemic in the southern African country.

Misinformation and rumours have constantly cast a pall on the fight against COVID-19. In July, the World Health Organization (WHO) office in Angola and the Ministry of Health set up the COVID-19 Alliance – a system to fight the surge of potentially harmful misinformation shared mostly online.

The COVID-19 Alliance tracks and analyses conversations around the pandemic on social and traditional media and rebuts misleading information. Regular updates and key messages about the disease are also published on its website, shared on social media and through its own WhatsApp platform.

Rumours tracked by the platform relate mainly to mentions of disease, testing, treatment, vaccine and response by local authorities and partners. ""When I heard that I had to drink alcohol or eat garlic to avoid COVID-19, I was more scared than relieved because I knew that was not true,"" says Denise Miranda, who lives in the capital Luanda.

""Sometimes it is frightening to see how fake and yet creative the circulating rumours are,” says Elchadai Destino, a regular user of the COVID-19 Alliance platform who received a WhatsApp message encouraging people to disregard preventive measures on claims that the disease was no longer dangerous.

Popular myths on the COVID-19 misinformation landscape in Angola include warnings against child polio vaccination because it is an experiment for COVID-19 vaccine, or that the disease does not exist in the country, and hoaxes about winning a COVID-19 sweepstake by calling a given number.

""Access to officially verified information is critical regarding COVID-19 prevention as well as when it comes to ensuring the good health of the population,” says Dr Djamila Cabral, WHO representative for Angola. ""Promoting access to correct information and battling misinformation contributes to a better participation of the population in the response to this unprecedented pandemic.”

The COVID-19 Alliance system receives around 100 calls a day from people seeking to clarification on rumours, accessing tests, facts about the disease and how it is transmitted as well as preventive measures.

Lizandro Chissupa, the head of the technology firm managing the COVID-19 Alliance platform, is confident that the initiative will help “diminish the impact of misinformation in our country and to guide people take the right preventive measures.”

Angola has integrated infodemic management in its response to end the COVID-19 pandemic. In the African region, WHO, partner organizations and fact-checking groups have launched an alliance to track and counter misinformation on the pandemic and other health emergencies.

Dr Cabral affirms that WHO in Angola will continue supporting the Ministry of Health to bolster infodemic management and other measures to promote public health awareness.

“Misinformation can lead to confusion and ultimately distrust in governments and the public health response,” she says. “We will continue to support the implementation of key interventions that provide citizens with clear information based on evidence and which leads to positive health behaviours.”",https://www.afro.who.int
139,"Abuja – When Regina Otokpa, an Abuja-based journalist, co-authored a newspaper article on poor observance of mask-wearing and physical distancing directives in Nigeria, it caused some buzz.

Reaction to the report was swift. Government officials reinforced warnings against disregarding the preventive measures, while medical personnel voiced satisfaction that awareness had been created among policymakers: health workers are at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection, and in Nigeria more than 2000 health workers have been infected by the disease.

“The report caused quite a stir because it helped stakeholders identify loopholes that could cause more harm rather than flatten the COVID-19 curve,” says Otokpa who covers health and business for the paper.

She is among the country’s reporters who have turned an investigative spotlight on the Nigerian response to the pandemic and are helping to create awareness of the disease, which has so far infected more than 67 000 people and claimed 1173 lives.

At the onset of the pandemic misinformation and rumours were rife in Nigeria. Outlandish claims ranged from COVID-19 causes such as 5G wireless technology to lemon tea as a viable therapy. Rumours circulating on WhatsApp that the disease was a ruse by some to spread fear and divert funds meant to fight the virus was especially hard to debunk, says Ayodamola Owoseye, a reporter with an Abuja-based paper.

Early in the outbreak, it was difficult to find experts to turn to, Owoseye says, as most researchers had little understanding of the virus. Yet, there were volumes of unverified information online. Some people turned away from her reports altogether, she remembers. “People became scared and stopped reading the news. They claimed it was affecting them psychologically.""

To help counter misinformation, the World Health Organization (WHO) office in Nigeria has trained national journalists, focusing on the principles of public health reporting that include information accuracy, data sourcing and verification. The training also aimed to help change people’s behaviour in the face of COVID-19.

The Organization has supported the work of more than 100 reporters across Nigeria since March to understand and relay technical terms and educate the public about the pandemic. WHO also provides real-time information on COVID-19 response and prevention. In Abuja alone, 50 journalists have been trained and another 100 in the north-east states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe.

WHO continues to collaborate with the media to debunk false information. Staff from the Organization also participate in national radio and television programmes to speak about the pandemic.

Nigerian newsrooms are using different approaches to fight misinformation. Some directly address the rumours by producing lists of fake information along with write-ups debunking them. Others have fact-checking teams for in-depth verification.

At Dubawa, the fact-checking arm of Premium Times, a major Nigerian newspaper, reporters have been publishing reports to counter rumours and address people’s worries on COVID-19, using creative tools like graphics and videos. Dubawa is the first such initiative in the country and works to fight false news and deter propagators of misleading information.

“We journalists should keep reporting about COVID-19 so that people will be aware that it's not yet time to celebrate,” says Bukola Afeni, a reporter with Newsday, an online publication, referring to a declining number of in-depth reporting on the pandemic.",https://www.afro.who.int

The day’s mission is to improve awareness of all contraceptive methods available and enable young people to make informed choices on their sexual and reproductive health. The 28th of September marks the annual International Safe Abortion Day which is a day of action in support of the right to safe abortion.

To mark that days in 2020, WHO AFRO conducted a social media campaign to raise awareness on existing modern contraceptive methods.This campaign aimed to increase understanding of contraception’s usefulness in the fight against sexually transmitted diseases including HIV, and unwanted pregnancies, which most often lead to high-risk abortions and maternal mortality.

The three-day campaign was conducted in English and French on WHO Africa’s Twitter and Facebook profiles. It reached more than 76,000 people. The messages were liked more than 2200

times and created more than 4000 interactions.

Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses.

There are some key differences between flu and COVID-19. COVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some people. It can also take longer before people show symptoms and people can be contagious for longer. Another important difference is there is a vaccine to protect against flu. There is currently a limited supply of COVID-19 vaccine in the United States, but supply will increase in the weeks and months to come. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to the virus. More information about differences between flu and COVID-19 is available in the different sections below.

Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis. Flu and COVID-19 share many characteristics, but there are some key differences between the two.

179,"No. Ct values should not be used to determine a patient’s viral load, how infectious a person may be, or when a person can be released from isolation or quarantine.

An RT-PCR test uses multiple repeating amplification cycles to create more and more copies of the virus’ genetic material. Specimens with lower amounts of virus will require more cycles to amplify that genetic material to reach an amount that can be detected, resulting in a higher Ct value. Thus, there is a correlation between the Ct value and the amount of starting viral genetic material that was present in the specimen.

For both qualitative and quantitative RT-PCR assays, the correlation between Ct values and the amount of virus in the original specimen is imperfect. It is therefore problematic to infer any relationship between an individual patient’s Ct value and their viral load. Ct values can also be affected by factors other than viral load. For example, if the specimen is not collected or stored properly or the specimen is collected early during the infection, the Ct value may be higher than it would be under ideal conditions. Thus, a high Ct value could also result from factors not related to the amount of virus in the specimen. The correlation between Ct and viral load can be used to evaluate data from groups of people and infer the difference in the relative amount of viral load between the two groups (e.g., between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals).",https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html

195,"Outpatient/Emergency Department Illness

Two syndromic surveillance systems, the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) and the National Syndromic Surveillance Project (NSSP), are being used to monitor trends in outpatient and emergency department (ED) visits that may be associated with COVID-19 illness. Each system monitors activity in a slightly different set of providers/facilities and uses a slightly different set of symptoms that may be associated with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. ILINet provides information about visits to outpatient providers or emergency departments for influenza-like illness (ILI; fever plus cough and/or sore throat) and NSSP provides information about visits to EDs for ILI and COVID-like illness (CLI; fever plus cough and/or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing). Some EDs contribute ILI data to both ILINet and NSSP. Both systems are currently being affected by changes in health care seeking behavior, including increased use of telemedicine and increased social distancing. These changes affect the numbers of people seeking care in the outpatient and ED settings and their reasons for doing so. Syndromic data, including CLI and ILI, should be interpreted with caution and should be evaluated in combination with other sources of surveillance data, especially laboratory testing results, to obtain a complete and accurate picture of respiratory illness.

Nationally, the overall percentages of visits to outpatient providers or EDs for ILI and CLI have remained stable or declined slightly since late November. During week 50, the percentages of ED visits captured in NSSP for CLI and ILI were 6.6% and 1.3%, respectively. This represents a stable (change of ≤0.1%) level of CLI and ILI compared with week 49. In ILINet, 1.6% of visits reported during week 50 were for ILI, also remaining stable (change of ≤0.1%) for the fourth consecutive week and below the national baseline (2.4% for October 2019 through September 2020; 2.6% since October 2020) for the 35th consecutive week. This level of ILI is lower than is typical for ILINet during this time of year.

resize icon View Larger Close

The percentages of visits for ILI reported in ILINet for all age groups (0–4 years, 5–24 years, 25–49 years, 50–64 years, 65 years and older) have remained stable (change of ≤0.1%) since mid-November.

On a regional levelexternal icon, three regions (Region 2 [New Jersey/New York/Puerto Rico], 3 [Mid-Atlantic] and 9 [South West/Coast]) reported an increase in at least one indicator of mild to moderate illness (CLI and/or ILI) during week 50 compared with week 49. The remaining seven regions (1 [New England], 4 [Southeast], 5 [Midwest], 6 [South Central], 7[Central], 8 [Mountain], and 10 [Pacific Northwest) reported a decreasing or stable (change of ≤0.1%) level of mild to moderate illness. The percentage of visits for ILI to ILINet providers remained below the region-specific baseline in all regions.

ILI Activity Levels

Data collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of ILI activity for all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the District of Columbia, New York City and for each core-based statistical area (CBSA) where at least one provider is located. The mean reported percentage of visits due to ILI for the current week is compared with the mean reported during non-influenza weeks, and the activity levels correspond to the number of standard deviations below, at, or above the mean.

The number of jurisdictions at each activity level during week 50 and the previous week are summarized in the table below.

ILI Activity Levels Activity Level Number of Jurisdictions Number of CBSAs Week 50 (Week ending Dec. 12, 2020) Week 49 (Week ending Dec. 5, 2020) Week 50 (Week ending Dec. 12, 2020) Week 49 (Week ending Dec. 5, 2020) Very High 0 0 0 0 High 0 0 4 5 Moderate 1 0 8 13 Low 0 4 43 59 Minimal 51 49 566 556 Insufficient Data 3 2 308 296

*Note: Data collected in ILINet may disproportionally represent certain populations within a state and may not accurately depict the full picture of respiratory disease activity for the whole state. Differences in the data presented here by CDC and independently by some state health departments likely represent differing levels of data completeness with data presented by the state likely being the more complete.

SPHERES Overview

The SPHERES consortium is being led by CDC’s Advanced Molecular Detection (AMD) program, which over the past six years has invested in federal, state, and local public health laboratories to expand the use of pathogen genomics and other advanced laboratory technologies to strengthen infectious disease surveillance and outbreak response. SPHERES aims to

Accelerate the use of real-time pathogen sequence data and molecular epidemiology for the COVID-19 pandemic response.

Organize and manage public health sequencing and response efforts across the United States.

Coordinate and support sequencing at state and local public health laboratories across the country.

Better engage US clinical, academic, and commercial laboratories that are sequencing—or planning to sequence—SARS-CoV-2 data on any scale.

Improve communication and knowledge-sharing between US laboratories.

Develop consensus guidance on critical data and metadata standards.

Reduce barriers to bioinformatic analysis and data sharing.

Better align sequencing requirements and resource needs with different sources of funding, technology, expertise, and other means of support.

The SPHERES consortium includes 37 state and local public health laboratories, several large regional and national clinical diagnostic corporations, and academic and non-profit leaders in pathogen genomics, bioinformatics, and public health from across the country. Moreover, the consortium aligns federal laboratories and public health agencies with international genomics efforts and engages the private sector in efforts to better understand the genomics and patterns of SARS-CoV-2 transmission across the United States.

If possible, stay away from others, especially people who are at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19

Options to reduce quarantine

Reducing the length of quarantine may make it easier for people to quarantine by reducing the time they cannot work. A shorter quarantine period also can lessen stress on the public health system, especially when new infections are rapidly rising.

Your local public health authorities make the final decisions about how long quarantine should last, based on local conditions and needs. Follow the recommendations of your local public health department if you need to quarantine. Options they will consider include stopping quarantine

After day 10 without testing

After day 7 after receiving a negative test result (test must occur on day 5 or later)

After stopping quarantine, you should

Watch for symptoms until 14 days after exposure.

If you have symptoms, immediately self-isolate and contact your local public health authority or healthcare provider.

Wear a mask, stay at least 6 feet from others, wash your hands, avoid crowds, and take other steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

CDC continues to endorse quarantine for 14 days and recognizes that any quarantine shorter than 14 days balances reduced burden against a small possibility of spreading the virus. CDC will continue to evaluate new information and update recommendations as needed.

Confirmed and suspected cases of reinfection of the virus that causes COVID-19

Cases of reinfection of COVID-19 have been reported but are rare. In general, reinfection means a person was infected (got sick) once, recovered, and then later became infected again. Based on what we know from similar viruses, some reinfections are expected.",https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html
206,"Since November 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) has reported a rapid increase in COVID-19 cases in London and southeast England. This rapid increase in cases has been linked to a different version—or variant—of the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). Public health professionals in the UK are evaluating the characteristics of this new variant.

What we know

Viruses constantly change through mutation, and new variants of a virus are expected to occur over time. Sometimes new variants emerge and disappear. Other times, new variants emerge and start infecting people. Multiple variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 have been documented in the United States and globally during this pandemic.

The virus that causes COVID-19 is a type of coronavirus, a large family of viruses. Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surfaces. Scientists monitor changes in the virus, including changes to the spikes on the surface of the virus. These studies, including genetic analyses of the virus, are helping us understand how changes to the virus might affect how it spreads and what happens to people who are infected with it.

Recent reports indicate that about 6 in 10 cases reported in London are caused by the new variant. Genetic analysis of the new variant shows changes to the spikes on the virus and to other parts of the virus. Initial studies suggest that the new variant may spread more easily from person to person. So far, scientists in the UK see no evidence that infections by this variant cause more severe disease.

What we do not know

It is still very early in the identification of this variant, so we have a great deal to learn. More studies on the new variant are needed to understand

How widely the new variant has spread in the UK and potentially around the world

How the new variant differs from earlier variants

How the disease caused by this variant differs from the disease caused by other variants that are currently circulating

What it means

Public health officials are quickly studying the new variant to learn more so that they can control its spread. They want to understand whether the new variant

Spreads more easily from person to person

Causes milder or more severe disease in people

Is detected by currently available viral tests

Responds to medicines currently being used to treat people for COVID-19

Affects the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. There is no evidence that this is occurring, and most experts believe this is unlikely to occur because of the nature of the virus.

Some countries have announced travel bans to and from the UK while scientists work to better understand the new variant.

What CDC is doing

CDC is monitoring the situation in the UK and communicating with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. CDC and state and local health departments are continually monitoring and studying the virus spreading in the United States to quickly detect any changes. As new information becomes available, CDC will provide updates.",https://espanol.cdc.gov

Before You Consider Traveling

Travel can increase your chance of spreading and getting COVID-19. Postponing travel and staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.

If you are considering traveling, here are some important questions to ask yourself and your loved ones beforehand. These questions can help you decide what is best for you and your family.

Are you, someone in your household, or someone you will be visiting at increased risk for getting very sick from COVID-19?

If you get infected you can spread the virus to loved ones during travel and when you return, even if you don’t have symptoms. If your household includes one or more individuals at increased risk for severe illness, all family members should act as if they, themselves are at increased risk. Learn how to protect yourself and others.

If you get infected you can spread the virus to loved ones during travel and when you return, even if you don’t have symptoms. If your household includes one or more individuals at increased risk for severe illness, Learn how to protect yourself and others. Are cases high or increasing in your community or your destination? The more cases in your community of origin or at your destination, the more likely you are to get and spread COVID-19 as a result of your door-to-door travel. Check Each State’s Cases in the Last 7 Days .



Are hospitals in your community or your destination overwhelmed with patients who have COVID-19? To find out, check state and local public health department websites.

Does your home or destination have requirements or restrictions for travelers? Check state and local requirements before you travel.

During the 14 days before your travel, have you or those you are visiting had close contact with people they don’t live with?

The following activities can put you at higher risk for COVID-19: Going to a large social gathering like a wedding, funeral, or party. Attending a mass gathering like a sporting event, concert, or parade. Being in crowds like in restaurants, bars, fitness centers, or movie theaters. Being on trains, buses, in airports, or using public transportation. Traveling on a cruise ship or river boat.

The following activities can put you at higher risk for COVID-19: Do your plans include traveling by bus, train, or air which might make staying 6 feet apart difficult?

Are you traveling with people who don’t live with you?

If the answer to any of these questions is “yes,” you should consider making other plans, such as delaying your travel.

If You Decide to Travel

Travel may increase your chance of spreading and getting COVID-19. Postponing travel and staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. If you do decide to travel, be sure to take these steps during your trip to protect yourself and others from COVID-19:

Check travel restrictions before you go.

Get your flu shot before you travel.

Bring extra supplies, such as masks and hand sanitizer.

Know when to delay your travel. Do not travel if you or your travel companions are sick.

Wear a mask to keep your nose and mouth covered when in public settings, including on public transportation and in transportation hubs such as airports and stations.

Avoid close contact by staying at least 6 feet apart (about 2 arm lengths) from anyone who is not from your travel group.

Wash your hands often or use hand sanitizer (with at least 60% alcohol).

Avoid contact with anyone who is sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

Consider testing

Testing could improve traveler safety.

The safest thing to do is to stay home, but if you do decide to travel, testing can help you do so more safely. You and your travel companions (including children) may feel well and not have any symptoms, but you can still spread COVID-19 to others in busy travel environments like in airports, and bus and train stations. You can also spread it to family, friends, and your community after travel. Testing does not eliminate all risk, but it can help make travel safer.

If you are traveling, consider getting tested with a viral test 1-3 days before your trip. Also consider getting tested with a viral test 3-5 days after your trip and reduce non-essential activities for a full 7 days after travel, even if your test is negative. If you don’t get tested, consider reducing non-essential activities for 10 days after travel.

Keep a copy of your test results with you during travel; you may be asked for them.

Do not travel if you test positive ; immediately isolate yourself, and follow public health recommendations.

; immediately isolate yourself, and follow public health recommendations. You may have been exposed to COVID-19 on your travels.

Considerations for Types of Travel

Travel increases your chances of spreading and getting COVID-19. Some travel activities, like the transportation you choose and where you stay, can increase your risk of getting COVID-19. Know your travel risk. Your chances of getting COVID-19 while traveling also depends on whether you and those around you take steps to protect yourselves and others, such as wearing masks and staying 6 feet away from people outside your travel group (social distancing). Airports, bus stations, train stations, and rest stops are all places travelers can be exposed to the virus in the air and on surfaces. These are also places where it can be hard to social distance. In general, the longer you are around a person with COVID-19, the more likely you are to get infected.

Air travel Air travel requires spending time in security lines and airport terminals, which can bring you in close contact with other people and frequently touched surfaces. Most viruses and other germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air is circulated and filtered on airplanes. However, social distancing is difficult on crowded flights and sitting within 6 feet of others, sometimes for hours, may increase your risk of getting COVID-19. How you get to and from the airport, such as with public transportation and ridesharing, can also increase your chances of being exposed to the virus. Bus or train travel Traveling on buses and trains for any length of time can involve being in crowded terminals and sitting or standing within 6 feet of others, which may increase your risk of getting COVID-19. If you choose to travel by bus or train, learn what you can do to protect yourself on public transportation. Car travel Making stops along the way for gas, food, or bathroom breaks can put you and your traveling companions in close contact with other people and frequently touched surfaces. RV travel You may have to stop less often for food or bathroom breaks, but RV travel usually means staying at RV parks overnight and getting gas and supplies at other public places. These stops may put you and those with you in the RV in close contact with others. Learn more about how to protect yourself from COVID-19 on different types of transportation.

How Are Transportation Companies Protecting Customers from COVID-19? When planning travel, you may want to check transportation companies’ websites to see what they are doing to protect customers from COVID-19. Things to look for include: Requiring people to wear a mask.

Promoting social distancing.

Using online or contactless reservations and check-in.

Using contactless payment.

Enhanced cleaning procedures.

Considerations for Staying with Family or Friends

If you, someone you live with, or anyone you plan to visit is at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, consider staying in a separate accommodation like a hotel, guest house, or short-stay rental.

Tips for staying overnight or hosting overnight guests

Be prepared. Know what you will do if you or someone else becomes sick during the visit. What are your plans for isolation, medical care, basic care, and travel home when it is safe to do so?

Wear masks while in shared spaces inside the house. Masks may be removed for eating, drinking, and sleeping, but individuals from different households should stay at least 6 feet away from each other at all times.

Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially upon arrival.

Visitors should launder clothing and masks and stow luggage away from common areas upon arrival.

Improve ventilation by opening windows and doors or by placing central air and heating on continuous circulation.

Spend time together outdoors. Take a walk or sit outdoors at least 6 feet apart for interpersonal interactions.

Avoid singing or shouting, especially indoors.

Treat pets as you would other human family members – do not let pets interact with people outside the household.

Monitor hosts and guests for symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath.

Tips to avoid getting and spreading COVID-19 in common travel situations:

In public:

Bathrooms and rest stops:

Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after using the bathroom and after you have been in a public place.

If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

Getting gas:

Use disinfecting wipes on handles and buttons at the gas pumps before you touch them (if available).

After fueling, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. When you get to your destination, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

Hotels and accommodations:

212,"When to Delay your Travel

The COVID-19 pandemic may be stressful for people. Traveling with or to visit family or friends can be a stress reliever, but it also increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19. You don’t want to miss out on a planned trip, but there are situations when cancelling or postponing travel makes sense for you and those you care about. Delaying your trip when you could spread COVID-19 also protects other travelers, people who work in travel settings, and those at your destination.

Check these common scenarios to see if you or your travel companions should delay your travel. This list does not include all possible situations. Talk to your health care provider before you travel if you are unsure whether any of these situations apply to you or your travel companions. CDC will continue to update this information as we learn more about COVID-19.

Some travel activities, like the transportation you choose and where you stay, can increase your risk of getting COVID-19. Your chances of exposure are higher if you come into close contact with others, especially people you don’t know, or use shared public facilities (like restrooms). COVID-19 is spreading in the United States and in many international destinations. Visiting locations where there are fewer cases of COVID-19 may be less risky for getting COVID-19 than visiting locations where there are more cases of COVID-19.

Before you travel, learn which travel activities are lower risk to protect yourself and others. Keep in mind that getting from one place to another is just one piece of the travel risk. Your activities and who you interact with before, during, and after travel may increase your risk.

Transportation

Your chances of getting COVID-19 while traveling depends not only on the length of the trip and the number of stops, but also on whether you and those around you take precautions, such as wearing masks and staying at least 6 feet away from other people. Airports, bus stations, train stations, and rest stops are all places travelers can be exposed to the virus through respiratory droplets or on surfaces. These are also places where it can be hard to keep your distance. In general, the longer you are around a person with COVID-19 (even if they do not have symptoms), the more likely you are to get infected.

When traveling on any public transportation, wear a mask for the duration of your trip, including while waiting in transportation hubs (airports, bus or ferry terminals, train or subway stations, seaports, or similar areas), while on public transportation conveyances (e.g., airplanes, ships, ferries, trains, subways, buses, taxis, ride-shares), and at your destination.

During car travel, making stops along the way for gas, food, or bathroom breaks can put you and your traveling companions in close contact with other people and frequently touched surfaces. If traveling in a RV, you may have to stop less often for food or bathroom breaks, but you could still be in close contact with others while staying at RV parks overnight and while getting gas and supplies at public places.

Traveling on buses and trains for any length of time can involve sitting or standing within 6 feet of others, which may increase your risk of getting COVID-19. If you choose to travel by bus or train, learn what you can do to protect yourself on public transportation.

The following information aims to help people in the groups listed below make an informed decision about receiving the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.

People who have weakened immune systems

People with HIV and those with weakened immune systems due to other illnesses or medication might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19. They may receive a COVID-19 vaccine. However, they should be aware of the limited safety data:

Information about the safety of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines for people who have weakened immune systems in this group is not yet available.

People living with HIV were included in clinical trials, though safety data specific to this group are not yet available at this time.

People with weakened immune systems should also be aware of the potential for reduced immune responses to the vaccine, as well as the need to continue following all current guidance to protect themselves against COVID-19 (see below).

People who have autoimmune conditions

People with autoimmune conditions may receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. However, they should be aware that no data are currently available on the safety of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines for them. Individuals from this group were eligible for enrollment in clinical trials.

People who have previously had Guillain-Barre syndrome

Persons who have previously had GBS may receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. To date, no cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) have been reported following vaccination among participants in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials. With few exceptions, the independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) general best practice guidelines for immunization do not include a history of GBS as a precaution to vaccination with other vaccines.

People who have previously had Bell’s palsy

Cases of Bell’s palsy were reported in participants in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not consider these to be above the rate expected in the general population. They have not concluded these cases were caused by vaccination. Therefore, persons who have previously had Bell’s Palsy may receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.

After vaccination, current guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19 should be followed

While it is known and expected that viruses constantly change through mutation leading to the emergence of new variants, preliminary analysis in the UK suggests that the discovered variant may be more transmissible than previously circulating variants, with an estimated potential to increase the transmissibility of the virus by up to 70%.

Why aren’t we banning travel from the UK?

On March 14, 2020, President Trump issued a Presidential Proclamation to suspend the entry of foreign nationals who visited the UK in the past 14 days. This has reduced air travel to the US from the UK by 90%. This additional testing requirement will strengthen protection of the American public to improve their health and safety and ensure responsible international travel.

When does this order take effect?

This Order will go into effect at 7:01pm EST on December 27, 2020 (12:01 AM GMT on December 28, 2020).

What if I recently recovered from COVID-19?

CDC does not recommend getting tested again in the three months after a positive viral test, as long as you do not have symptoms of COVID-19. If you have had a positive viral test in the past 3 months, and you have met the criteria to end isolation, travel with a copy of your test results and a letter from your doctor or health department that states you have been cleared for travel.",https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html

222,"Monitoring

Watch for symptoms of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) such as cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever, chills, muscle pain, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell.

Do not go to work if you have any of the above symptoms.

If you are sick with COVID-19 or think you have COVID-19, you should isolate (separate yourself from others in a separate room) and follow CDC-recommended steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Isolation keeps someone who is infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, away from others, even in their home.

If you have had close contact to a person with COVID-19 (within six feet for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period), you should quarantine* for 14 days after last exposure. (Although CDC continues to recommend a 14-day quarantine, options are provided to shorten the quarantine period to after Day 7 or after Day 10 based on certain conditions, including test results.) Quarantine keeps someone who might have been exposed to the virus away from others: Stay home for 14 days (see above) after last contact with the confirmed COVID-19 case. Maintain social distance (at least six feet from other people). Self-monitor for symptoms (check temperature twice a day, watch for fever (feeling feverish or a measured temperature of 4°F or higher), cough, or shortness of breath). Avoid contact with people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 such as older adults and people with medical conditions. Contact your human resource and/or worker health unit coordinator.



Cleaning, Disinfection, and Sanitation

Practice hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette, and cleaning and disinfection.

Use soap, water, and paper towels for frequently washing your hands (at least 20 seconds). Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol frequently, when handwashing is not readily available. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your upper sleeves when you cough or sneeze. Avoid sharing objects and equipment with other employees, including phones, desks, or other workbenches, tools and equipment, when possible. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces, like shared tools, machines, vehicles and other equipment, handrails, ladders, doorknobs, and portable toilets. Surfaces that are visibly dirty should be cleaned with soap and water before disinfection.



Social Distancing and Face Masks

Utilize social distancing guidelines and face masks guidelines: Maintain at least six feet distance (about 2 arms’ length) between workers, wherever possible. Maintain social distancing during breaks and when eating. Avoid enclosed areas like trailers and tight/confined spaces. Wear face masks in worksites, especially when social distancing is difficult to maintain. Wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth for maximum protection (Don’t put the mask around your neck or up on your forehead). Don’t touch the outside of the mask when wearing it, and, if you do, wash your hands or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol to disinfect. Be careful not to touch your eyes, nose, and mouth when removing your mask and wash hands immediately after removing unless hands have been recently washed. Face masks are not replacements for respiratory protection when respirators are required.



Mental Health

Recognize factors that can add work- or home-related stress. Common factors that can add to stress during a pandemic: Concern about the risk of being exposed to the virus at work. Lack of access to the tools and equipment needed to perform your job. Conflict at home Failure to take time to relax Feelings that you are not contributing enough to work or guilt about not being on the frontline. Uncertainty about the future of your workplace and/or employment. Adapting to a different workspace and/or work schedule. Some ways to address stress and build resilience include:

Keep a regular sleep schedule external icon . Take breaks from work to stretch, exercise, or check in with supportive colleagues, coworkers, family, and friends. Spend time outdoors, either being physically active or relaxing. Practice mindfulness techniques external icon . Know the facts about COVID-19. Be informed about how to protect yourself and others. Understanding the risk and sharing accurate information with people you care about can reduce stress and help you make a connection with others. Connect with others. Talk with people you trust about your concerns, how you are feeling, or how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting you. Also considering using employee assistance programs or other resources that may be available to you.

227,"Today, President Trump is taking another step to protect the health of the American people by requiring air passengers arriving from the United Kingdom (U.K.) to test negative, via PCR or Antigen test, no more than 72 hours before departure from the U.K. to the United States.

The public health authorities in the United Kingdom recently announced the discovery of a new variant of SARS-CoV-2.

On March 14, President Trump issued a Presidential Proclamationexternal icon to suspend the entry of foreign nationals who visited the United Kingdom in the past 14 days. This has reduced air travel to the U.S. from the U.K. by about 90%.

The order is consistent with existing CDC testing guidance plus the HHS, U.S. Department of Transportation, and Department of Homeland Security joint guidance in the “Runway to Recoverypdf iconexternal icon” document.

This new order is consistent with the measures that have been taken so far to increase our ability to detect and contain COVID-19 proactively and aggressively.

Passengers are required to get a viral test (i.e., a test for current infection) within the 3 days before their flight from the U.K. to the U.S. departs, and provide written documentation of their laboratory test result (in hard copy or electronic) to the airline. Airlines must confirm the negative test result for all passengers before they board. If a passenger chooses not to take a test, the airline must deny boarding to the passenger.

This order will be signed by CDC Director Robert Redfield, M.D., tomorrow, December 25, and become effective on December 28, 2020.",https://espanol.cdc.gov
228,"The United States achieved an early but important milestone today – jurisdictions have now reported that more than 1 million people have received their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine since administration began 10 days ago.

With cases of COVID-19 continuing to surge nationwide, this achievement comes at a critical time and will help to protect those on the frontlines – our healthcare providers treating COVID-19 patients – as well as our most vulnerable: elder individuals living in nursing homes and assisted living facilities.

While we celebrate this historic milestone, we also acknowledge the challenging path ahead. There is currently a limited supply of COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S., but supply will increase in the weeks and months to come. The goal is for everyone to be able to easily get vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as large enough quantities are available.

CDC, along with DoD and other federal partners, continues to work closely with state, local, tribal, and territorial health departments to combat the spread of COVID-19, and distribute COVID-19 vaccine doses as quickly as possible to accomplish vaccination of the American public.

Vaccination is a critical tool in bringing this unprecedented pandemic to an end. But until every person in the U.S. is able to get a COVID-19 vaccine, we continue to ask Americans to embrace proven public health strategies including social distancing, good hand hygiene, and wearing a mask in public to reduce the risk of transmission and protect our communities.",https://espanol.cdc.gov
229,"Over 81,000 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United States in the 12 months ending in May 2020, the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a 12-month period, according to recent provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

While overdose deaths were already increasing in the months preceding the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the latest numbers suggest an acceleration of overdose deaths during the pandemic.

“The disruption to daily life due to the COVID-19 pandemic has hit those with substance use disorder hard,” said CDC Director Robert Redfield, M.D. “As we continue the fight to end this pandemic, it’s important to not lose sight of different groups being affected in other ways. We need to take care of people suffering from unintended consequences.”

Synthetic opioids (primarily illicitly manufactured fentanyl) appear to be the primary driver of the increases in overdose deaths, increasing 38.4 percent from the 12-month period leading up to June 2019 compared with the 12-month period leading up to May 2020. During this time period:

37 of the 38 U.S. jurisdictions with available synthetic opioid data reported increases in synthetic opioid-involved overdose deaths.

18 of these jurisdictions reported increases greater than 50 percent.

10 western states reported over a 98 percent increase in synthetic opioid-involved deaths.

Overdose deaths involving cocaine also increased by 26.5 percent. Based upon earlier research, these deaths are likely linked to co-use or contamination of cocaine with illicitly manufactured fentanyl or heroin. Overdose deaths involving psychostimulants, such as methamphetamine, increased by 34.8 percent. The number of deaths involving psychostimulants now exceeds the number of cocaine-involved deaths.

“The increase in overdose deaths is concerning.” said Deb Houry, M.D., M.P.H., director of CDC’s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. “CDC’s Injury Center continues to help and support communities responding to the evolving overdose crisis. Our priority is to do everything we can to equip people on the ground to save lives in their communities.”

CDC recommendations

The increase in overdose deaths highlights the need for essential services to remain accessible for people most at risk of overdose and the need to expand prevention and response activities. CDC issued a health advisory today to medical and public health professionals, first responders, harm reduction organizations, and other community partners recommending the following actions as appropriate based on local needs and characteristics:

Expand distribution and use of naloxone and overdose prevention education.

Expand awareness about and access to and availability of treatment for substance use disorders.

Intervene early with individuals at highest risk for overdose.

Improve detection of overdose outbreaks to facilitate more effective response.

What CDC is doing

Measures taken at the national, state, and local level to address the COVID-19 pandemic may have unintended consequences for substance use and overdose, but CDC is working with states, territories, tribes, cities, and counties across the country to continue drug overdose surveillance and prevention efforts. This includes assessing overdose data to understand trends, as well as working with funded jurisdictions to provide flexibilities where needed and technical assistance to identify strategies to inform public health action during the COVID-19 pandemic.

CDC began a multiyear Overdose Data to Action cooperative agreement in September 2019 and funds health departments in 47 states; Washington, D.C.; two territories; and 16 cities and counties for drug overdose surveillance and prevention efforts. Funds awarded as part of this agreement support health departments in obtaining high quality, more comprehensive, and timelier data on overdose morbidity and mortality and using those data to inform prevention and response efforts.

CDC is committed to preventing opioid and other drug misuse, overdoses, and deaths through five key strategies:

Using data to monitor emerging trends and direct prevention activities;

Strengthening state, local, and tribal capacity to respond to the epidemic;

Working with providers, health systems, and payers to reduce unsafe exposure to opioids and treat addiction;

Coordinating with public safety and community-based partners to rapidly identify overdose threats, reverse overdoses, link people to effective treatment, and reduce harms associated with illicit opioids; and

Increasing public awareness about the risks of opioids.

257,"FORT HUACHUCA, Ariz. -- Thousands of Advanced Individual Training Soldiers departed Fort Huachuca this weekend following months of Army planning to ensure the troops could take leave safely despite COVID-19.“Taking care of people is a leader responsibility,” said Brig. Gen. Anthony R. Hale, commander, U.S. Army Intelligence Center of Excellence. “Finding ways to return these Soldiers home for the holidays is vital to their mental health and wellness, especially in this COVID era.”Basic Training and AIT are known for their restrictions as Soldiers move from civilian life to the Army, but these Soldiers have faced a more difficult experience than most as their movements were even more tightly controlled to protect their formations from COVID.“We really owe a debt of gratitude to these Soldiers and their families who not only raised their hands to serve but then stood with us patiently throughout this year to ensure they and their teammates were as safe as possible,” said Command Sgt. Major Warren K. Robinson, command sergeant major, U.S. Army Intelligence Center of Excellence. “We know they are tired and have COVID fatigue, we feel it too. But I thank them for doing the right things and making these sacrifices so we can continue our training mission in the safest ways possible.”Soldiers were required to preplan their travel and have their destinations reviewed by U.S. Army Intelligence Center cadre and commanders. The reviews ensured the destinations and travel plans were acceptable risks and in-line with the organization’s mitigation measures.“They will be in touch with their drill sergeants and cadre while they are gone, and have training on what to do and who to call should they start feeling symptomatic or find they are at an increased risk,” said Hale. “They know to wash their hands frequently for 20 seconds or more, wear their masks, watch their distance, and watch out for one another. CSM and I trust them to do the right things.”Soldiers were tested for COVID and isolated before their departures and will be tested again upon their return. Regardless of the test result, all returning Soldier will restrict their movement for 14 days before rejoining others on Fort Huachuca, or entering the training environment.“We’ve worked with medical experts to find the best ways to reestablish the clean training ‘bubble’ around our formations once they return and we think this is it. Ultimately, there must be some level of acceptable risk to do what’s right for these Soldiers and allow them to return to their loved ones for the holidays. They are at the very beginning of their careers, and there is no doubt many of them will miss some special days in the future, but there’s no reason that had to be this year for these Soldiers.”In 2020, Soldiers, like other Americans, have experienced increased stressors and the suicide rate has surpassed previous years. Hale is often heard discussing this and the unacceptable level of suicides and suicidal ideations with his staff.“People are my number one priority and as leaders, we absolutely have to take care of our Soldiers, civilians, contractors, and their families. This means understanding their obstacles and needs, and getting them the support they need in the most timely fashion,” said Hale. “Mental health is vital to military readiness. We need Soldiers to be mentally well, physically strong and healthy, socially connected, and spiritually satisfied. Building and supporting these pillars of resiliency ultimately affects our readiness as an Army and therefore our national security, but even if that were not the case, it is simply the right thing to do to take care of people.”Hale and Robinson drove to the Tucson International Airport Saturday morning from Sierra Vista to accompany the Soldiers on their way out. They visited with the troops, and in some cases, their families, just to ensure they were doing well and answer any last-minute questions personnel may have.Soldiers said they appreciated the command team’s presence and snapped selfies with the senior leaders who asked what they wanted to do most when the Soldiers got home.“I want to play with my dog,” said two Soldiers standing in line for coffee.“You have a dog!?” asked Hale. “Have you seen my puppy?”Whipping out his phone to show the Soldiers his young Boxer named Bailey, smiles beamed across the trio’s faces, even if only apparent in their eyes, as laughs came muffled from behind their masks.“It’s really nice of them to come out here and spend time with us,” said a Soldier. “It really shows they care.”The Soldiers will return after a couple of weeks away during which the few who chose to stay at Fort Huachuca will enjoy special activities tailored for them by the chaplain, USO, and museum.“I hope they all enjoy this much-deserved time-off,” said Robinson. “They should eat a little bit too much because they can run it off. Regardless, we look forward to having everyone back happy and healthy to resume our training after the first of the year.”Soldiers are reminded to reach out for help if needed.

“We worked to determine their needs, place the order on their behalf, and determined how we could best support them,” said Maj. Sofia Szari, 81st Healthcare Operations Squadron chief of allergy and immunology. “We had to work through our credentials and legal staff to draft a new memorandum of agreement with the Armed Forces Retirement Home to allow our staff to administer the vaccine.”



The 81st MDG personnel took charge of the process and are responsible for delivery and storage.



“We drove to Pensacola to pick up the vaccine and delivered it to the residents and staff to initiate same-day vaccination,” Szari said. “We are providing safe and secure storage for their vaccines at our facility as they do not have the ability to store vaccines at the retirement home. When we pick them up from Naval Air Station Pensacola, (Florida) the vaccines are taken out of ultra-cold storage, and we have five days to use all vaccines before they expire. We are driving them out daily from Keesler and bringing back any leftovers to Keesler to prevent wasted vaccines.”



The process of providing the vaccine to the residents could span over multiple weeks, depending on how many residents volunteer to receive the vaccine. Along with the residents, some Keesler Air Force Base medics and first responders have started volunteering to receive the vaccine.



“The Defense Department has prioritized personnel falling under the department into different phases to receive the vaccine based off of a national prioritization plan and members of the 81st Medical Group have stepped up in full force to provide relief to our community members at the retirement home, who have volunteered to receive the vaccine,” said Col. Christopher Estridge, 81st MDG commander. “The DoD prioritization plan that we are following will help reduce the burden of the COVID-19 disease in high-risk populations, while mitigating the risk to ongoing military operations.”



Members of the 81st MDG have provided COVID-19 assistance to the Armed Forces Retirement Home throughout the pandemic, through testing for the virus and now administering the vaccine to prevent future spread. The Keesler Medical Center has been the forerunner in the fight against COVID-19 on the Gulf Coast by being one of the few hospitals in the Air Force to have a rapid platform for COVID-19 testing for members of Team Keesler and community partners at the Armed Forces Retirement Home.



“This is a beautiful example of a time when the Air Force sees a need in the area and pulls together to meet that need,” Neaves said. “Keesler's leadership saw a need for a high-risk population in the area. To my knowledge, the residents of the retirement home have been living in isolation and have not been able to leave the facility or have any friends or family members visit them for the last 10 months due to the COVID-19 threat. This vaccine provides them with a hope not only for their health, but also for their overall well-being.”",https://www.defense.gov
261,"NASA Astronaut Mike Hopkins became the first-ever U.S. Space Force officer assigned as an astronaut when he voluntarily transferred from the U.S. Air Force while in orbit on the International Space Station, adding to a long history of military officers working at NASA in a civilian capacity. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine and NASA Deputy Administrator Jim Morhard joined Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett and Chief of Space Operations General Jay Raymond from NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., for the ceremony.

“This unique venue for Mike’s transfer ceremony today highlights the decades-long partnership between the Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,” Bridenstine said. “Although our missions remain distinct and different, our partnership has successfully allowed our nation to boldly explore the vast expanses of space and expand humanity’s scientific knowledge. NASA is proud to have service members from all branches of the military serving as civilian astronauts for over 60 years.”

The ceremony, which coincided with the Space Force one-year anniversary on Dec. 20, also served as an opportunity to highlight the partnership between NASA and the U.S. Space Force in the space domain.

“We are different organizations but we operate in the same domain,” said Raymond. “That partnership provides us great strength. We are making history every single day, and today is nothing short of that.

“The military sends its best people to the NASA astronaut program,” Raymond added. “And Hopkins, you are one of the nation’s best. We are beyond excited to make you the first astronaut in our Space Force, and to welcome your wife Julie, and your sons, Ryan and Lucas, to our Space Force family. Today, you are beginning a new journey with the nation’s newest service.”

NASA is a civilian space agency created to benefit humanity through space exploration, scientific discovery and expand knowledge through peaceful international cooperation. Since the beginning of NASA’s space exploration missions, men and women of the military such as Hopkins have served as civilians at NASA. While NASA is independent from the military, all branches of the U.S. military have provided talent – test pilots, engineers, doctors, and more – to the astronaut corps since NASA’s first astronauts were announced in 1959. The U.S. Space Force, as the newest military service, will also contribute to this legacy of supporting NASA’s human exploration of space.

NASA as a civilian agency and Space Force as a branch of the military operate in the same domain of space, supporting America’s national interests. NASA focuses on exploration, research and development for education, innovation, economic vitality, and stewardship of Earth. Space Force delivers the critical space capabilities needed to protect and defend America‘s interests in space, as well as access to and freedom to maneuver in space. Space Force will be celebrating its first birthday on Dec. 20.

Hopkins was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Air Force in January 1992, and was selected by NASA to become an astronaut in 2009. He launched from Florida on the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft on Nov. 15 as a member of NASA’s Crew-1 mission, and is currently working and living aboard the space station as a flight engineer for Expedition 64 until spring. For more than 20 years, astronauts have had a continuous presence aboard the orbiting laboratory, helping to further knowledge of space and Earth, improve our understanding of life, and enable leaps in commercial technology and medicine. The Department of Defense is an important partner in that endeavor and will continue to be so for many more years.",https://www.defense.gov

(Photo by Senior Master Sgt. Julie Avey)

EIELSON AIR FORCE BASE, Alaska – The 168th Wing's holiday celebration was a little different this year, with masks and social distancing due to COVID-19, but it still brought joy to families.

Volunteers from different squadrons of the Alaska Air National Guard's 168th Wing built holiday scenes for children to celebrate as a part of a wing competition on Dec. 12.

Families drove through the winter wonderland display, and if the children's smiles and loud ""thank-you's"" heard through the car windows were any indication, it was a holiday hit.

""Sharing love in a time of need is important,"" said Capt. Anthony Robinson, 168th Communications Squadron commander.

As the holiday season began, members of the wing talked about how to keep the holiday spirit alive for the kids this year.

""We knew we would have to come up with a new way to celebrate,"" said Jason Dandurand, director of 168th Wing family readiness and programs. ""The traditional holiday parties our military kids are used to around this time of the year were not an option with the gathering restrictions, but we still wanted to create lasting memories for the kids.""

The wing traditionally celebrates the holidays with a pancake breakfast. In years past, the children of wing members play games, participate in crafts, visit Santa, enjoy treats, and have fun visiting with other kids who have parents in the military.

""My kids have been going to the breakfast party ever since we joined the unit in 2008,"" said Master Sgt. Shelley Lutrell. ""My youngest was a newborn, and my oldest had the Santa spirit, so she always loved playing the games with Santa. Now she likes to volunteer and keep the spirit alive for her little sister. Last year my oldest daughter and her friends ran the cakewalk and had fun watching all the little ones try to stay on the spots.""

The Airmen and family volunteers spend many hours ensuring details of the pancake breakfast are magical every year. They also enjoy getting to know people in different squadrons or units.

""The drive-thru event this year was smart given the circumstance,"" said Lutrell. ""The team of volunteers found a way to find happiness and Christmas spirit even when the world is in a tough spot.""

This year the volunteers competed building holiday scenes. ""We still had the opportunity to get involved but in smaller groups,"" said Lutrell. ""I think this was great for team building and a little wing competition. It was fun to see everyone go all out.""

The volunteers built creative displays such as a Grinch sleigh, a flying KC-135 Stratotanker, life-size gingerbread, a live nativity scene, teddy bear world, Elf on the Shelf fun, all complete with dancing elves and twinkling lights everywhere.

""It was amazing to be able to help the kids and brighten their day in these different times we're in right now,"" said Staff Sgt. Donald Cronce of the 168th Communications Squadron.

Staff Sgt. Jake Vogel agreed. ""It feels good to able to do something good for others. Everyone still gets to come out and help.""

The fuels shop, security forces, communications squadron, recruiting office, civil engineering, and force support squadron took part in the friendly competition.

Senior Airman Colton Peet of 168th Security Forces quoted the character from Elf: ""The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear."" Peet volunteered and was dancing and singing on duty at his post during the drive-thru celebration.

""It was great with all that is going on,"" said Staff Sgt. Cameron Holt, security forces, and another volunteer elf. He referenced Aladdin: ""Ain't never met an elf like me.""

The holiday scenes were displayed in an extended garage, and the volunteers were comfortably warm as the temperatures were negative 20 degrees the morning of the event. Several families drove through the display and stopped at the end for a quick visit with Santa.",https://www.defense.gov

277,"In December, the Office of Industrial Policy’s Small Business Program submitted the DoD Small Business Strategy to Congress. The Strategy focuses on three strategic goals: creating and implementing a unified management structure across the Department’s small business workforce; aligning the Department’s small business activities with the National Defense Strategy (NDS), National Security Strategy, and Executive Order 13806; and strengthening DoD’s ability to support the warfighter and serve small businesses.

In the strategy, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper states, “A unified management structure will consist of both the Under Secretaries of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment and Research and Engineering working together to ensure the United States retains technical superiority over its adversaries. This structure will assist the Department in assessing priorities across stakeholders, identifying opportunities for enhancement, and leveraging the significant efforts of other departments and agencies that also focus on supporting small businesses. Meanwhile, alignment of the Department’s small business activities with the objectives of the NDS will ensure our work has a meaningful impact on securing our allies and nation’s future. The Department is also working to identify opportunities to improve its day-to-day support of small businesses, maximize the utility of each individual program, and replicate our most successful tactics across lines of effort. These goals and objectives aim to leverage the might of the millions of entrepreneurs and small business owners across the nation to help secure our future.”

The participation of dynamic, robust, and modern small businesses in the industrial base is critical to the United States’ efforts to maintain its technological superiority, military readiness, and lethality. The strategy pursues a wide variety of methods to unlock small business capabilities, change the acquisition culture of the Department towards small businesses, and improve acquisition processes to simplify and enhance how small companies do business with the Department of Defense. In the execution of this strategy, the Department will increase and improve small business workforce training, focus key innovation programs on small business participation, increase commercialization, develop the right tools for acquisition professionals, and streamline policy and regulations where appropriate. This multi-faceted effort will encourage every organization of the Department of Defense to support and promote these initiatives to create a more synchronized, modernized, and agile small business industrial base.",https://business.defense.gov

The Department also awarded $49 billion in subcontracts to small businesses—a $7 billion increase over FY 2017.

Scott Baum, Acting Director of the Small Business Programs and Principal Director within the Office of Industrial Policy announced, “I am happy to report that for the first time ever, the Department of Defense awarded more than $70 billion in prime contracts to small business and achieved an ‘A’ on the Small Business Administration procurement scorecard. In another milestone, DoD federal prime and subcontracts awarded to small businesses in FY2018 exceeded $120 billion for the first time, creating more than 654,000 American jobs.

Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses.

There are some key differences between flu and COVID-19. COVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some people. It can also take longer before people show symptoms and people can be contagious for longer. Another important difference is there is a vaccine to protect against flu. There is currently a limited supply of COVID-19 vaccine in the United States, but supply will increase in the weeks and months to come. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to the virus. More information about differences between flu and COVID-19 is available in the different sections below.

Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis. Flu and COVID-19 share many characteristics, but there are some key differences between the two.

359,"No. Ct values should not be used to determine a patient’s viral load, how infectious a person may be, or when a person can be released from isolation or quarantine.

An RT-PCR test uses multiple repeating amplification cycles to create more and more copies of the virus’ genetic material. Specimens with lower amounts of virus will require more cycles to amplify that genetic material to reach an amount that can be detected, resulting in a higher Ct value. Thus, there is a correlation between the Ct value and the amount of starting viral genetic material that was present in the specimen.

For both qualitative and quantitative RT-PCR assays, the correlation between Ct values and the amount of virus in the original specimen is imperfect. It is therefore problematic to infer any relationship between an individual patient’s Ct value and their viral load. Ct values can also be affected by factors other than viral load. For example, if the specimen is not collected or stored properly or the specimen is collected early during the infection, the Ct value may be higher than it would be under ideal conditions. Thus, a high Ct value could also result from factors not related to the amount of virus in the specimen. The correlation between Ct and viral load can be used to evaluate data from groups of people and infer the difference in the relative amount of viral load between the two groups (e.g., between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals).",https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html

CDC works with partners to bring together weekly forecasts based on statistical or mathematical models that aim to predict:

National and state numbers of new and total COVID-19 deaths per week for the next 4 weeks.

National and state numbers of new COVID-19 hospitalizations per day for the next 4 weeks.

National, state, and county numbers of new COVID-19 cases per week for the next 4 weeks.

Forecasting teams predict numbers of deaths, hospitalizations, and cases using different types of data (e.g., COVID-19 data, demographic data, mobility data), methods, and estimates of the impacts of interventions (e.g., social distancing, use of face coverings). These forecasts are developed independently and shared publicly. It is important to bring these forecasts together to help understand how they compare with each other and how much uncertainty there is about what may happen in the near future.

An “ensemble” forecast combines each of the independently developed forecasts into one aggregate forecast to improve prediction over the next 4 weeks.

375,"Outpatient/Emergency Department Illness

Two syndromic surveillance systems, the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) and the National Syndromic Surveillance Project (NSSP), are being used to monitor trends in outpatient and emergency department (ED) visits that may be associated with COVID-19 illness. Each system monitors activity in a slightly different set of providers/facilities and uses a slightly different set of symptoms that may be associated with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. ILINet provides information about visits to outpatient providers or emergency departments for influenza-like illness (ILI; fever plus cough and/or sore throat) and NSSP provides information about visits to EDs for ILI and COVID-like illness (CLI; fever plus cough and/or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing). Some EDs contribute ILI data to both ILINet and NSSP. Both systems are currently being affected by changes in health care seeking behavior, including increased use of telemedicine and increased social distancing. These changes affect the numbers of people seeking care in the outpatient and ED settings and their reasons for doing so. Syndromic data, including CLI and ILI, should be interpreted with caution and should be evaluated in combination with other sources of surveillance data, especially laboratory testing results, to obtain a complete and accurate picture of respiratory illness.

Nationally, the overall percentages of visits to outpatient providers or EDs for ILI and CLI have remained stable or declined slightly since late November. During week 50, the percentages of ED visits captured in NSSP for CLI and ILI were 6.6% and 1.3%, respectively. This represents a stable (change of ≤0.1%) level of CLI and ILI compared with week 49. In ILINet, 1.6% of visits reported during week 50 were for ILI, also remaining stable (change of ≤0.1%) for the fourth consecutive week and below the national baseline (2.4% for October 2019 through September 2020; 2.6% since October 2020) for the 35th consecutive week. This level of ILI is lower than is typical for ILINet during this time of year.

The percentages of visits for ILI reported in ILINet for all age groups (0–4 years, 5–24 years, 25–49 years, 50–64 years, 65 years and older) have remained stable (change of ≤0.1%) since mid-November.

On a regional levelexternal icon, three regions (Region 2 [New Jersey/New York/Puerto Rico], 3 [Mid-Atlantic] and 9 [South West/Coast]) reported an increase in at least one indicator of mild to moderate illness (CLI and/or ILI) during week 50 compared with week 49. The remaining seven regions (1 [New England], 4 [Southeast], 5 [Midwest], 6 [South Central], 7[Central], 8 [Mountain], and 10 [Pacific Northwest) reported a decreasing or stable (change of ≤0.1%) level of mild to moderate illness. The percentage of visits for ILI to ILINet providers remained below the region-specific baseline in all regions.

ILI Activity Levels

Data collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of ILI activity for all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the District of Columbia, New York City and for each core-based statistical area (CBSA) where at least one provider is located. The mean reported percentage of visits due to ILI for the current week is compared with the mean reported during non-influenza weeks, and the activity levels correspond to the number of standard deviations below, at, or above the mean.

The number of jurisdictions at each activity level during week 50 and the previous week are summarized in the table below.

376,"A National Open Genomics Consortium for the COVID-19 Response

CDC is leading the SARS-CoV-2 Sequencing for Public Health Emergency Response, Epidemiology and Surveillance (SPHERES), a new national genomics consortium to coordinate SARS-CoV-2 sequencing across the United States. Large-scale, rapid genomic sequencing of the virus that causes COVID-19 will allow public health experts to

Monitor important changes in the virus as it continues to circulate.

Gain important insights to support contact tracing.

Provide crucial information to aid in identifying diagnostic and therapeutic targets.

Advance public health research in the areas of transmission dynamics, host response, and evolution of the virus.

With extensive participation from US clinical and public health laboratories, academic institutions, and the private sector, the SPHERES consortium aims to generate information about the virus that will strengthen COVID-19 mitigation strategies.

SPHERES Overview

The SPHERES consortium is being led by CDC’s Advanced Molecular Detection (AMD) program, which over the past six years has invested in federal, state, and local public health laboratories to expand the use of pathogen genomics and other advanced laboratory technologies to strengthen infectious disease surveillance and outbreak response. SPHERES aims to

Accelerate the use of real-time pathogen sequence data and molecular epidemiology for the COVID-19 pandemic response.

Organize and manage public health sequencing and response efforts across the United States.

Coordinate and support sequencing at state and local public health laboratories across the country.

Better engage US clinical, academic, and commercial laboratories that are sequencing—or planning to sequence—SARS-CoV-2 data on any scale.

Improve communication and knowledge-sharing between US laboratories.

Develop consensus guidance on critical data and metadata standards.

Reduce barriers to bioinformatic analysis and data sharing.

Better align sequencing requirements and resource needs with different sources of funding, technology, expertise, and other means of support.

The SPHERES consortium includes 37 state and local public health laboratories, several large regional and national clinical diagnostic corporations, and academic and non-profit leaders in pathogen genomics, bioinformatics, and public health from across the country. Moreover, the consortium aligns federal laboratories and public health agencies with international genomics efforts and engages the private sector in efforts to better understand the genomics and patterns of SARS-CoV-2 transmission across the United States.

If possible, stay away from others, especially people who are at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19

Options to reduce quarantine

Reducing the length of quarantine may make it easier for people to quarantine by reducing the time they cannot work. A shorter quarantine period also can lessen stress on the public health system, especially when new infections are rapidly rising.

Your local public health authorities make the final decisions about how long quarantine should last, based on local conditions and needs. Follow the recommendations of your local public health department if you need to quarantine. Options they will consider include stopping quarantine

After day 10 without testing

After day 7 after receiving a negative test result (test must occur on day 5 or later)

After stopping quarantine, you should

Watch for symptoms until 14 days after exposure.

If you have symptoms, immediately self-isolate and contact your local public health authority or healthcare provider.

Wear a mask, stay at least 6 feet from others, wash your hands, avoid crowds, and take other steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

CDC continues to endorse quarantine for 14 days and recognizes that any quarantine shorter than 14 days balances reduced burden against a small possibility of spreading the virus. CDC will continue to evaluate new information and update recommendations as needed. See Options to Reduce Quarantine for Contacts of Persons with SARS-CoV-2 Infection Using Symptom Monitoring and Diagnostic Testing for guidance on options to reduce quarantine.

Confirmed and suspected cases of reinfection of the virus that causes COVID-19

Cases of reinfection of COVID-19 have been reported but are rare. In general, reinfection means a person was infected (got sick) once, recovered, and then later became infected again. Based on what we know from similar viruses, some reinfections are expected.",https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html
386,"Since November 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) has reported a rapid increase in COVID-19 cases in London and southeast England. This rapid increase in cases has been linked to a different version—or variant—of the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). Public health professionals in the UK are evaluating the characteristics of this new variant.

What we know

Viruses constantly change through mutation, and new variants of a virus are expected to occur over time. Sometimes new variants emerge and disappear. Other times, new variants emerge and start infecting people. Multiple variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 have been documented in the United States and globally during this pandemic.

The virus that causes COVID-19 is a type of coronavirus, a large family of viruses. Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surfaces. Scientists monitor changes in the virus, including changes to the spikes on the surface of the virus. These studies, including genetic analyses of the virus, are helping us understand how changes to the virus might affect how it spreads and what happens to people who are infected with it.

Recent reports indicate that about 6 in 10 cases reported in London are caused by the new variant. Genetic analysis of the new variant shows changes to the spikes on the virus and to other parts of the virus. Initial studies suggest that the new variant may spread more easily from person to person. So far, scientists in the UK see no evidence that infections by this variant cause more severe disease.

What we do not know

It is still very early in the identification of this variant, so we have a great deal to learn. More studies on the new variant are needed to understand

How widely the new variant has spread in the UK and potentially around the world

How the new variant differs from earlier variants

How the disease caused by this variant differs from the disease caused by other variants that are currently circulating

What it means

Public health officials are quickly studying the new variant to learn more so that they can control its spread. They want to understand whether the new variant

Spreads more easily from person to person

Causes milder or more severe disease in people

Is detected by currently available viral tests

Responds to medicines currently being used to treat people for COVID-19

Affects the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. There is no evidence that this is occurring, and most experts believe this is unlikely to occur because of the nature of the virus.

Some countries have announced travel bans to and from the UK while scientists work to better understand the new variant.

What CDC is doing

CDC is monitoring the situation in the UK and communicating with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. CDC and state and local health departments are continually monitoring and studying the virus spreading in the United States to quickly detect any changes. As new information becomes available, CDC will provide updates.",https://espanol.cdc.gov

Before You Consider Traveling

Travel can increase your chance of spreading and getting COVID-19. Postponing travel and staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.

If you are considering traveling, here are some important questions to ask yourself and your loved ones beforehand. These questions can help you decide what is best for you and your family.

Are you, someone in your household, or someone you will be visiting at increased risk for getting very sick from COVID-19?

If you get infected you can spread the virus to loved ones during travel and when you return, even if you don’t have symptoms. If your household includes one or more individuals at increased risk for severe illness, all family members should act as if they, themselves are at increased risk. Learn how to protect yourself and others.

If you get infected you can spread the virus to loved ones during travel and when you return, even if you don’t have symptoms. If your household includes one or more individuals at increased risk for severe illness, Learn how to protect yourself and others. Are cases high or increasing in your community or your destination? The more cases in your community of origin or at your destination, the more likely you are to get and spread COVID-19 as a result of your door-to-door travel. Check Each State’s Cases in the Last 7 Days .



Are hospitals in your community or your destination overwhelmed with patients who have COVID-19? To find out, check state and local public health department websites.

Does your home or destination have requirements or restrictions for travelers? Check state and local requirements before you travel.

During the 14 days before your travel, have you or those you are visiting had close contact with people they don’t live with?

The following activities can put you at higher risk for COVID-19: Going to a large social gathering like a wedding, funeral, or party. Attending a mass gathering like a sporting event, concert, or parade. Being in crowds like in restaurants, bars, fitness centers, or movie theaters. Being on trains, buses, in airports, or using public transportation. Traveling on a cruise ship or river boat.

The following activities can put you at higher risk for COVID-19: Do your plans include traveling by bus, train, or air which might make staying 6 feet apart difficult?

Are you traveling with people who don’t live with you?

If the answer to any of these questions is “yes,” you should consider making other plans, such as delaying your travel.

If You Decide to Travel

Travel may increase your chance of spreading and getting COVID-19. Postponing travel and staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. If you do decide to travel, be sure to take these steps during your trip to protect yourself and others from COVID-19:

Check travel restrictions before you go.

Get your flu shot before you travel.

Bring extra supplies, such as masks and hand sanitizer.

Know when to delay your travel. Do not travel if you or your travel companions are sick.

Wear a mask to keep your nose and mouth covered when in public settings, including on public transportation and in transportation hubs such as airports and stations.

Avoid close contact by staying at least 6 feet apart (about 2 arm lengths) from anyone who is not from your travel group.

Wash your hands often or use hand sanitizer (with at least 60% alcohol).

Avoid contact with anyone who is sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

Consider testing

Testing could improve traveler safety.

The safest thing to do is to stay home, but if you do decide to travel, testing can help you do so more safely. You and your travel companions (including children) may feel well and not have any symptoms, but you can still spread COVID-19 to others in busy travel environments like in airports, and bus and train stations. You can also spread it to family, friends, and your community after travel. Testing does not eliminate all risk, but it can help make travel safer.

If you are traveling, consider getting tested with a viral test 1-3 days before your trip. Also consider getting tested with a viral test 3-5 days after your trip and reduce non-essential activities for a full 7 days after travel, even if your test is negative. If you don’t get tested, consider reducing non-essential activities for 10 days after travel.

Keep a copy of your test results with you during travel; you may be asked for them.

Do not travel if you test positive ; immediately isolate yourself, and follow public health recommendations.

; immediately isolate yourself, and follow public health recommendations. You may have been exposed to COVID-19 on your travels. You and your travel companions (including children) may pose a risk to your family, friends, and community. Regardless of where you traveled or what you did during your trip, take these actions to protect others from getting COVID-19 for 14 days after travel: Stay at least 6 feet/2 meters (about 2 arm lengths) from anyone who did not travel with you, particularly in crowded areas. It’s important to do this everywhere — both indoors and outdoors.

Considerations for Types of Travel

Travel increases your chances of spreading and getting COVID-19. Some travel activities, like the transportation you choose and where you stay, can increase your risk of getting COVID-19. Know your travel risk. Your chances of getting COVID-19 while traveling also depends on whether you and those around you take steps to protect yourselves and others, such as wearing masks and staying 6 feet away from people outside your travel group (social distancing). Airports, bus stations, train stations, and rest stops are all places travelers can be exposed to the virus in the air and on surfaces. These are also places where it can be hard to social distance. In general, the longer you are around a person with COVID-19, the more likely you are to get infected.

Air travel Air travel requires spending time in security lines and airport terminals, which can bring you in close contact with other people and frequently touched surfaces. Most viruses and other germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air is circulated and filtered on airplanes. However, social distancing is difficult on crowded flights and sitting within 6 feet of others, sometimes for hours, may increase your risk of getting COVID-19. How you get to and from the airport, such as with public transportation and ridesharing, can also increase your chances of being exposed to the virus. Bus or train travel Traveling on buses and trains for any length of time can involve being in crowded terminals and sitting or standing within 6 feet of others, which may increase your risk of getting COVID-19. If you choose to travel by bus or train, learn what you can do to protect yourself on public transportation. Car travel Making stops along the way for gas, food, or bathroom breaks can put you and your traveling companions in close contact with other people and frequently touched surfaces. RV travel You may have to stop less often for food or bathroom breaks, but RV travel usually means staying at RV parks overnight and getting gas and supplies at other public places. These stops may put you and those with you in the RV in close contact with others. Learn more about how to protect yourself from COVID-19 on different types of transportation.

How Are Transportation Companies Protecting Customers from COVID-19? When planning travel, you may want to check transportation companies’ websites to see what they are doing to protect customers from COVID-19. Things to look for include: Requiring people to wear a mask.

Promoting social distancing.

Using online or contactless reservations and check-in.

Using contactless payment.

Enhanced cleaning procedures.

Considerations for Staying with Family or Friends

If you, someone you live with, or anyone you plan to visit is at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, consider staying in a separate accommodation like a hotel, guest house, or short-stay rental.

Tips for staying overnight or hosting overnight guests

Be prepared. Know what you will do if you or someone else becomes sick during the visit. What are your plans for isolation, medical care, basic care, and travel home when it is safe to do so?

Wear masks while in shared spaces inside the house. Masks may be removed for eating, drinking, and sleeping, but individuals from different households should stay at least 6 feet away from each other at all times.

Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially upon arrival.

Visitors should launder clothing and masks and stow luggage away from common areas upon arrival.

Improve ventilation by opening windows and doors or by placing central air and heating on continuous circulation.

Spend time together outdoors. Take a walk or sit outdoors at least 6 feet apart for interpersonal interactions.

Avoid singing or shouting, especially indoors.

Treat pets as you would other human family members – do not let pets interact with people outside the household.

Monitor hosts and guests for symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath.

Tips to avoid getting and spreading COVID-19 in common travel situations:

In public:

Bathrooms and rest stops:

Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after using the bathroom and after you have been in a public place.

If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

Getting gas:

Use disinfecting wipes on handles and buttons at the gas pumps before you touch them (if available).

After fueling, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. When you get to your destination, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

Hotels and accommodations:

392,"When to Delay your Travel

The COVID-19 pandemic may be stressful for people. Traveling with or to visit family or friends can be a stress reliever, but it also increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19. You don’t want to miss out on a planned trip, but there are situations when cancelling or postponing travel makes sense for you and those you care about. Delaying your trip when you could spread COVID-19 also protects other travelers, people who work in travel settings, and those at your destination.

Check these common scenarios to see if you or your travel companions should delay your travel. This list does not include all possible situations. Talk to your health care provider before you travel if you are unsure whether any of these situations apply to you or your travel companions. CDC will continue to update this information as we learn more about COVID-19.

393,"Travel increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19. Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.

Some travel activities, like the transportation you choose and where you stay, can increase your risk of getting COVID-19. Your chances of exposure are higher if you come into close contact with others, especially people you don’t know, or use shared public facilities (like restrooms). COVID-19 is spreading in the United States and in many international destinations. Visiting locations where there are fewer cases of COVID-19 may be less risky for getting COVID-19 than visiting locations where there are more cases of COVID-19.

Before you travel, learn which travel activities are lower risk to protect yourself and others. Keep in mind that getting from one place to another is just one piece of the travel risk. Your activities and who you interact with before, during, and after travel may increase your risk.

Transportation

Your chances of getting COVID-19 while traveling depends not only on the length of the trip and the number of stops, but also on whether you and those around you take precautions, such as wearing masks and staying at least 6 feet away from other people. Airports, bus stations, train stations, and rest stops are all places travelers can be exposed to the virus through respiratory droplets or on surfaces. These are also places where it can be hard to keep your distance. In general, the longer you are around a person with COVID-19 (even if they do not have symptoms), the more likely you are to get infected.

When traveling on any public transportation, wear a mask for the duration of your trip, including while waiting in transportation hubs (airports, bus or ferry terminals, train or subway stations, seaports, or similar areas), while on public transportation conveyances (e.g., airplanes, ships, ferries, trains, subways, buses, taxis, ride-shares), and at your destination.

During car travel, making stops along the way for gas, food, or bathroom breaks can put you and your traveling companions in close contact with other people and frequently touched surfaces. If traveling in a RV, you may have to stop less often for food or bathroom breaks, but you could still be in close contact with others while staying at RV parks overnight and while getting gas and supplies at public places.

Traveling on buses and trains for any length of time can involve sitting or standing within 6 feet of others, which may increase your risk of getting COVID-19. If you choose to travel by bus or train, learn what you can do to protect yourself on public transportation.

Air travel requires spending time in security lines and airport terminals, which can bring you in close contact with other people and frequently touched surfaces. Most viruses and other germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes. However, keeping your distance is difficult on crowded flights, and sitting within 6 feet of others, sometimes for hours, may increase your risk of getting COVID-19.

Travel may increase your chance of spreading and getting COVID-19. CDC continues to recommend postponing travel and staying home, as this is the best way to protect yourself and others this year.

If you are considering traveling for the winter holidays, here are some important questions to ask yourself and your loved ones beforehand. These questions can help you decide what is best for you and your family.

Are you, someone in your household, or someone you will be visiting at increased risk for getting very sick from COVID-19?

Are cases high or increasing in your community or at your destination? The more cases in your community or at your destination, the more likely you are to get and spread COVID-19 as a result of your door-to-door travel. Check CDC’s COVID Data Tracker for the latest number of cases in each area.

Are hospitals in your community or at your destination overwhelmed with patients who have COVID-19? To find out, check state and local public health department websites.

Does your home or destination have requirements or restrictions for travelers? Check state and local requirements before you travel.

During the 14 days before your travel, have you or those you are visiting had close contact with people they don’t live with?

Do your plans include traveling by bus, train, or airplane, which might make staying 6 feet apart difficult?

Are you traveling with people who don’t live with you?

If the answer to any of these questions is “yes,” you should consider making other plans, such as hosting a virtual gathering or delaying your travel.

The following information aims to help people in the groups listed below make an informed decision about receiving the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.

People who have weakened immune systems

People with HIV and those with weakened immune systems due to other illnesses or medication might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19. They may receive a COVID-19 vaccine. However, they should be aware of the limited safety data:

Information about the safety of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines for people who have weakened immune systems in this group is not yet available.

People living with HIV were included in clinical trials, though safety data specific to this group are not yet available at this time.

People with weakened immune systems should also be aware of the potential for reduced immune responses to the vaccine, as well as the need to continue following all current guidance to protect themselves against COVID-19 (see below).

People who have autoimmune conditions

People with autoimmune conditions may receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. However, they should be aware that no data are currently available on the safety of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines for them. Individuals from this group were eligible for enrollment in clinical trials.

People who have previously had Guillain-Barre syndrome

Persons who have previously had GBS may receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. To date, no cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) have been reported following vaccination among participants in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials. With few exceptions, the independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) general best practice guidelines for immunization do not include a history of GBS as a precaution to vaccination with other vaccines.

People who have previously had Bell’s palsy

Cases of Bell’s palsy were reported in participants in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not consider these to be above the rate expected in the general population. They have not concluded these cases were caused by vaccination. Therefore, persons who have previously had Bell’s Palsy may receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.

After vaccination, current guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19 should be followed

This Order will go into effect at 7:01pm EST on December 27, 2020 (12:01am GMT on December 28, 2020).

Frequently Asked Questions

Does this requirement apply to US citizens?

This Order applies to all air passengers traveling from the UK to the US, including US citizens and legal permanent residents.

Can foreign nationals now enter the US from UK with a negative test?

With specific exceptions, foreign nationals who have been in the UK during the past 14 days may not enter the US, even with a negative test result. For more information, visit: Proclamation on the Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Certain Additional Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting Coronavirus | The White Houseexternal icon

When do I need to get a test to travel from the UK to the US? And what kind of test do I need?

Get tested no more than 3 days before your flight to the US from the UK departs. Make sure to be tested with a viral test (NAAT or antigen test) to determine if you are currently infected with COVID-19. Also make sure that you receive your results before your flight departs and have documentation of your results to show the airline.

Does this requirement apply if I have a layover in the UK?

No, this requirement does not apply to people with layovers of less than 24 hours in the UK.

Does this requirement apply if my travel started in the UK, but my flight to the US has a layover in another country/I’m transiting through another country on my way to the US?

If your travel starts in the UK, you are required to test negative for COVID-19 before travelling to the US.

Who is checking to make sure that people have a negative test before they board a plane in the UK?

The airline will confirm a COVID-19 negative test result for all passengers before boarding.

What happens if I don’t take a test and want to travel to the US from the UK?

Air passengers traveling from the UK to the US are required to have a negative COVID-19 test result. Airlines must confirm the negative test result for all passengers before boarding. If a passenger chooses not to take a test, the airline must deny boarding to the passenger.

What happens if I test positive?

People should self-isolate and delay their travel if symptoms develop or a pre-departure test result is positive. Airlines must refuse to board anyone who does not provide a negative test result for COVID-19.

What is a verifiable test result?

A verifiable test result must be in the form of written documentation (paper or electronic copy) of a laboratory test result. Testing must be performed using a viral test (NAAT or antigen), and negative results must be provided to the airline prior to boarding. The test result documentation must include information that identifies the person, a specimen collection date showing test was done within the 3 days before the flight, the type of test, and a negative result.

Do I need to get another test when I get to the United States?

CDC recommends that travelers get tested 3-5 days after travel AND stay home or otherwise self-quarantine for 7 days after travel. Even if you test negative, stay home for the full 7 days. If you don’t get tested, it’s safest to stay home for 10 days. Always follow state and local recommendations or requirements related to travel.

Remember to wear a mask, stay at least 6 feet apart from people who are not in your household, and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing and before eating. Look for symptoms of COVID-19, and take your temperature if you feel sick.

Watch for symptoms of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) such as cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever, chills, muscle pain, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell.

Do not go to work if you have any of the above symptoms.

If you are sick with COVID-19 or think you have COVID-19, you should isolate (separate yourself from others in a separate room) and follow CDC-recommended steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Isolation keeps someone who is infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, away from others, even in their home.

If you have had close contact to a person with COVID-19 (within six feet for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period), you should quarantine* for 14 days after last exposure. (Although CDC continues to recommend a 14-day quarantine, options are provided to shorten the quarantine period to after Day 7 or after Day 10 based on certain conditions, including test results.) Quarantine keeps someone who might have been exposed to the virus away from others: Stay home for 14 days (see above) after last contact with the confirmed COVID-19 case. Maintain social distance (at least six feet from other people). Self-monitor for symptoms (check temperature twice a day, watch for fever (feeling feverish or a measured temperature of 4°F or higher), cough, or shortness of breath). Avoid contact with people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 such as older adults and people with medical conditions. Contact your human resource and/or worker health unit coordinator.



Cleaning, Disinfection, and Sanitation

Practice hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette, and cleaning and disinfection.

Use soap, water, and paper towels for frequently washing your hands (at least 20 seconds). Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol frequently, when handwashing is not readily available. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your upper sleeves when you cough or sneeze. Avoid sharing objects and equipment with other employees, including phones, desks, or other workbenches, tools and equipment, when possible. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces, like shared tools, machines, vehicles and other equipment, handrails, ladders, doorknobs, and portable toilets. Surfaces that are visibly dirty should be cleaned with soap and water before disinfection.



Social Distancing and Face Masks

Utilize social distancing guidelines and face masks guidelines: Maintain at least six feet distance (about 2 arms’ length) between workers, wherever possible. Maintain social distancing during breaks and when eating. Avoid enclosed areas like trailers and tight/confined spaces. Wear face masks in worksites, especially when social distancing is difficult to maintain. Wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth for maximum protection (Don’t put the mask around your neck or up on your forehead). Don’t touch the outside of the mask when wearing it, and, if you do, wash your hands or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol to disinfect. Be careful not to touch your eyes, nose, and mouth when removing your mask and wash hands immediately after removing unless hands have been recently washed. Face masks are not replacements for respiratory protection when respirators are required.



Mental Health

Recognize factors that can add work- or home-related stress. Common factors that can add to stress during a pandemic: Concern about the risk of being exposed to the virus at work. Lack of access to the tools and equipment needed to perform your job. Conflict at home Failure to take time to relax Feelings that you are not contributing enough to work or guilt about not being on the frontline. Uncertainty about the future of your workplace and/or employment. Adapting to a different workspace and/or work schedule. Some ways to address stress and build resilience include:

Keep a regular sleep schedule external icon . Take breaks from work to stretch, exercise, or check in with supportive colleagues, coworkers, family, and friends. Spend time outdoors, either being physically active or relaxing. Practice mindfulness techniques external icon . Know the facts about COVID-19. Be informed about how to protect yourself and others. Understanding the risk and sharing accurate information with people you care about can reduce stress and help you make a connection with others. Connect with others. Talk with people you trust about your concerns, how you are feeling, or how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting you. Also considering using employee assistance programs or other resources that may be available to you.

409,"Over 81,000 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United States in the 12 months ending in May 2020, the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a 12-month period, according to recent provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

While overdose deaths were already increasing in the months preceding the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the latest numbers suggest an acceleration of overdose deaths during the pandemic.

“The disruption to daily life due to the COVID-19 pandemic has hit those with substance use disorder hard,” said CDC Director Robert Redfield, M.D. “As we continue the fight to end this pandemic, it’s important to not lose sight of different groups being affected in other ways. We need to take care of people suffering from unintended consequences.”

Synthetic opioids (primarily illicitly manufactured fentanyl) appear to be the primary driver of the increases in overdose deaths, increasing 38.4 percent from the 12-month period leading up to June 2019 compared with the 12-month period leading up to May 2020. During this time period:

37 of the 38 U.S. jurisdictions with available synthetic opioid data reported increases in synthetic opioid-involved overdose deaths.

18 of these jurisdictions reported increases greater than 50 percent.

10 western states reported over a 98 percent increase in synthetic opioid-involved deaths.

Overdose deaths involving cocaine also increased by 26.5 percent. Based upon earlier research, these deaths are likely linked to co-use or contamination of cocaine with illicitly manufactured fentanyl or heroin. Overdose deaths involving psychostimulants, such as methamphetamine, increased by 34.8 percent. The number of deaths involving psychostimulants now exceeds the number of cocaine-involved deaths.

“The increase in overdose deaths is concerning.” said Deb Houry, M.D., M.P.H., director of CDC’s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. “CDC’s Injury Center continues to help and support communities responding to the evolving overdose crisis. Our priority is to do everything we can to equip people on the ground to save lives in their communities.”

CDC recommendations

The increase in overdose deaths highlights the need for essential services to remain accessible for people most at risk of overdose and the need to expand prevention and response activities. CDC issued a health advisory today to medical and public health professionals, first responders, harm reduction organizations, and other community partners recommending the following actions as appropriate based on local needs and characteristics:

Expand distribution and use of naloxone and overdose prevention education.

Expand awareness about and access to and availability of treatment for substance use disorders.

Intervene early with individuals at highest risk for overdose.

Improve detection of overdose outbreaks to facilitate more effective response.

What CDC is doing

Measures taken at the national, state, and local level to address the COVID-19 pandemic may have unintended consequences for substance use and overdose, but CDC is working with states, territories, tribes, cities, and counties across the country to continue drug overdose surveillance and prevention efforts. This includes assessing overdose data to understand trends, as well as working with funded jurisdictions to provide flexibilities where needed and technical assistance to identify strategies to inform public health action during the COVID-19 pandemic.

CDC began a multiyear Overdose Data to Action cooperative agreement in September 2019 and funds health departments in 47 states; Washington, D.C.; two territories; and 16 cities and counties for drug overdose surveillance and prevention efforts. Funds awarded as part of this agreement support health departments in obtaining high quality, more comprehensive, and timelier data on overdose morbidity and mortality and using those data to inform prevention and response efforts.

CDC is committed to preventing opioid and other drug misuse, overdoses, and deaths through five key strategies:

Using data to monitor emerging trends and direct prevention activities;

Strengthening state, local, and tribal capacity to respond to the epidemic;

Working with providers, health systems, and payers to reduce unsafe exposure to opioids and treat addiction;

Coordinating with public safety and community-based partners to rapidly identify overdose threats, reverse overdoses, link people to effective treatment, and reduce harms associated with illicit opioids; and

Increasing public awareness about the risks of opioids.

Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses.

There are some key differences between flu and COVID-19. COVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some people. It can also take longer before people show symptoms and people can be contagious for longer. Another important difference is there is a vaccine to protect against flu. There is currently a limited supply of COVID-19 vaccine in the United States, but supply will increase in the weeks and months to come. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to the virus. More information about differences between flu and COVID-19 is available in the different sections below.

Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis. Flu and COVID-19 share many characteristics, but there are some key differences between the two.

An RT-PCR test uses multiple repeating amplification cycles to create more and more copies of the virus’ genetic material. Specimens with lower amounts of virus will require more cycles to amplify that genetic material to reach an amount that can be detected, resulting in a higher Ct value. Thus, there is a correlation between the Ct value and the amount of starting viral genetic material that was present in the specimen.

For both qualitative and quantitative RT-PCR assays, the correlation between Ct values and the amount of virus in the original specimen is imperfect. It is therefore problematic to infer any relationship between an individual patient’s Ct value and their viral load. Ct values can also be affected by factors other than viral load. For example, if the specimen is not collected or stored properly or the specimen is collected early during the infection, the Ct value may be higher than it would be under ideal conditions. Thus, a high Ct value could also result from factors not related to the amount of virus in the specimen. The correlation between Ct and viral load can be used to evaluate data from groups of people and infer the difference in the relative amount of viral load between the two groups (e.g., between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals).",https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html

CDC works with partners to bring together weekly forecasts based on statistical or mathematical models that aim to predict:

National and state numbers of new and total COVID-19 deaths per week for the next 4 weeks.

National and state numbers of new COVID-19 hospitalizations per day for the next 4 weeks.

National, state, and county numbers of new COVID-19 cases per week for the next 4 weeks.

Forecasting teams predict numbers of deaths, hospitalizations, and cases using different types of data (e.g., COVID-19 data, demographic data, mobility data), methods, and estimates of the impacts of interventions (e.g., social distancing, use of face coverings). These forecasts are developed independently and shared publicly. It is important to bring these forecasts together to help understand how they compare with each other and how much uncertainty there is about what may happen in the near future.

479,"Outpatient/Emergency Department Illness

Two syndromic surveillance systems, the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) and the National Syndromic Surveillance Project (NSSP), are being used to monitor trends in outpatient and emergency department (ED) visits that may be associated with COVID-19 illness. Each system monitors activity in a slightly different set of providers/facilities and uses a slightly different set of symptoms that may be associated with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. ILINet provides information about visits to outpatient providers or emergency departments for influenza-like illness (ILI; fever plus cough and/or sore throat) and NSSP provides information about visits to EDs for ILI and COVID-like illness (CLI; fever plus cough and/or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing). Some EDs contribute ILI data to both ILINet and NSSP. Both systems are currently being affected by changes in health care seeking behavior, including increased use of telemedicine and increased social distancing. These changes affect the numbers of people seeking care in the outpatient and ED settings and their reasons for doing so. Syndromic data, including CLI and ILI, should be interpreted with caution and should be evaluated in combination with other sources of surveillance data, especially laboratory testing results, to obtain a complete and accurate picture of respiratory illness.

Nationally, the overall percentages of visits to outpatient providers or EDs for ILI and CLI have remained stable or declined slightly since late November. During week 50, the percentages of ED visits captured in NSSP for CLI and ILI were 6.6% and 1.3%, respectively. This represents a stable (change of ≤0.1%) level of CLI and ILI compared with week 49. In ILINet, 1.6% of visits reported during week 50 were for ILI, also remaining stable (change of ≤0.1%) for the fourth consecutive week and below the national baseline (2.4% for October 2019 through September 2020; 2.6% since October 2020) for the 35th consecutive week. This level of ILI is lower than is typical for ILINet during this time of year.

resize icon View Larger Close

The percentages of visits for ILI reported in ILINet for all age groups (0–4 years, 5–24 years, 25–49 years, 50–64 years, 65 years and older) have remained stable (change of ≤0.1%) since mid-November.

On a regional levelexternal icon, three regions (Region 2 [New Jersey/New York/Puerto Rico], 3 [Mid-Atlantic] and 9 [South West/Coast]) reported an increase in at least one indicator of mild to moderate illness (CLI and/or ILI) during week 50 compared with week 49. The remaining seven regions (1 [New England], 4 [Southeast], 5 [Midwest], 6 [South Central], 7[Central], 8 [Mountain], and 10 [Pacific Northwest) reported a decreasing or stable (change of ≤0.1%) level of mild to moderate illness. The percentage of visits for ILI to ILINet providers remained below the region-specific baseline in all regions.

ILI Activity Levels

Data collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of ILI activity for all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the District of Columbia, New York City and for each core-based statistical area (CBSA) where at least one provider is located.

480,"A National Open Genomics Consortium for the COVID-19 Response

CDC is leading the SARS-CoV-2 Sequencing for Public Health Emergency Response, Epidemiology and Surveillance (SPHERES), a new national genomics consortium to coordinate SARS-CoV-2 sequencing across the United States. Large-scale, rapid genomic sequencing of the virus that causes COVID-19 will allow public health experts to

Monitor important changes in the virus as it continues to circulate.

Gain important insights to support contact tracing.

Provide crucial information to aid in identifying diagnostic and therapeutic targets.

Advance public health research in the areas of transmission dynamics, host response, and evolution of the virus.

With extensive participation from US clinical and public health laboratories, academic institutions, and the private sector, the SPHERES consortium aims to generate information about the virus that will strengthen COVID-19 mitigation strategies.

SPHERES Overview

The SPHERES consortium is being led by CDC’s Advanced Molecular Detection (AMD) program, which over the past six years has invested in federal, state, and local public health laboratories to expand the use of pathogen genomics and other advanced laboratory technologies to strengthen infectious disease surveillance and outbreak response. SPHERES aims to

Accelerate the use of real-time pathogen sequence data and molecular epidemiology for the COVID-19 pandemic response.

Organize and manage public health sequencing and response efforts across the United States.

Coordinate and support sequencing at state and local public health laboratories across the country.

Better engage US clinical, academic, and commercial laboratories that are sequencing—or planning to sequence—SARS-CoV-2 data on any scale.

Improve communication and knowledge-sharing between US laboratories.

Develop consensus guidance on critical data and metadata standards.

Reduce barriers to bioinformatic analysis and data sharing.

Better align sequencing requirements and resource needs with different sources of funding, technology, expertise, and other means of support.

The SPHERES consortium includes 37 state and local public health laboratories, several large regional and national clinical diagnostic corporations, and academic and non-profit leaders in pathogen genomics, bioinformatics, and public health from across the country. Moreover, the consortium aligns federal laboratories and public health agencies with international genomics efforts and engages the private sector in efforts to better understand the genomics and patterns of SARS-CoV-2 transmission across the United States.

If possible, stay away from others, especially people who are at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19

Options to reduce quarantine

Reducing the length of quarantine may make it easier for people to quarantine by reducing the time they cannot work. A shorter quarantine period also can lessen stress on the public health system, especially when new infections are rapidly rising.

Your local public health authorities make the final decisions about how long quarantine should last, based on local conditions and needs. Follow the recommendations of your local public health department if you need to quarantine. Options they will consider include stopping quarantine

After day 10 without testing

After day 7 after receiving a negative test result (test must occur on day 5 or later)

After stopping quarantine, you should

Watch for symptoms until 14 days after exposure.

If you have symptoms, immediately self-isolate and contact your local public health authority or healthcare provider.

Wear a mask, stay at least 6 feet from others, wash your hands, avoid crowds, and take other steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

CDC continues to endorse quarantine for 14 days and recognizes that any quarantine shorter than 14 days balances reduced burden against a small possibility of spreading the virus. CDC will continue to evaluate new information and update recommendations as needed.

Confirmed and suspected cases of reinfection of the virus that causes COVID-19

Cases of reinfection of COVID-19 have been reported but are rare. In general, reinfection means a person was infected (got sick) once, recovered, and then later became infected again. Based on what we know from similar viruses, some reinfections are expected.",https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html
490,"Since November 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) has reported a rapid increase in COVID-19 cases in London and southeast England. This rapid increase in cases has been linked to a different version—or variant—of the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). Public health professionals in the UK are evaluating the characteristics of this new variant.

What we know

Viruses constantly change through mutation, and new variants of a virus are expected to occur over time. Sometimes new variants emerge and disappear. Other times, new variants emerge and start infecting people. Multiple variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 have been documented in the United States and globally during this pandemic.

The virus that causes COVID-19 is a type of coronavirus, a large family of viruses. Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surfaces. Scientists monitor changes in the virus, including changes to the spikes on the surface of the virus. These studies, including genetic analyses of the virus, are helping us understand how changes to the virus might affect how it spreads and what happens to people who are infected with it.

Recent reports indicate that about 6 in 10 cases reported in London are caused by the new variant. Genetic analysis of the new variant shows changes to the spikes on the virus and to other parts of the virus. Initial studies suggest that the new variant may spread more easily from person to person. So far, scientists in the UK see no evidence that infections by this variant cause more severe disease.

What we do not know

It is still very early in the identification of this variant, so we have a great deal to learn. More studies on the new variant are needed to understand

How widely the new variant has spread in the UK and potentially around the world

How the new variant differs from earlier variants

How the disease caused by this variant differs from the disease caused by other variants that are currently circulating

What it means

Public health officials are quickly studying the new variant to learn more so that they can control its spread. They want to understand whether the new variant

Spreads more easily from person to person

Causes milder or more severe disease in people

Is detected by currently available viral tests

Responds to medicines currently being used to treat people for COVID-19

Affects the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. There is no evidence that this is occurring, and most experts believe this is unlikely to occur because of the nature of the virus.

Some countries have announced travel bans to and from the UK while scientists work to better understand the new variant.

What CDC is doing

CDC is monitoring the situation in the UK and communicating with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. CDC and state and local health departments are continually monitoring and studying the virus spreading in the United States to quickly detect any changes. As new information becomes available, CDC will provide updates.",https://espanol.cdc.gov

Before You Consider Traveling

Travel can increase your chance of spreading and getting COVID-19. Postponing travel and staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.

If you are considering traveling, here are some important questions to ask yourself and your loved ones beforehand. These questions can help you decide what is best for you and your family.

Are you, someone in your household, or someone you will be visiting at increased risk for getting very sick from COVID-19?

If you get infected you can spread the virus to loved ones during travel and when you return, even if you don’t have symptoms. If your household includes one or more individuals at increased risk for severe illness, all family members should act as if they, themselves are at increased risk. Learn how to protect yourself and others.

If you get infected you can spread the virus to loved ones during travel and when you return, even if you don’t have symptoms. If your household includes one or more individuals at increased risk for severe illness, Learn how to protect yourself and others. Are cases high or increasing in your community or your destination? The more cases in your community of origin or at your destination, the more likely you are to get and spread COVID-19 as a result of your door-to-door travel. Check Each State’s Cases in the Last 7 Days .



Are hospitals in your community or your destination overwhelmed with patients who have COVID-19? To find out, check state and local public health department websites.

Does your home or destination have requirements or restrictions for travelers? Check state and local requirements before you travel.

During the 14 days before your travel, have you or those you are visiting had close contact with people they don’t live with?

The following activities can put you at higher risk for COVID-19: Going to a large social gathering like a wedding, funeral, or party. Attending a mass gathering like a sporting event, concert, or parade. Being in crowds like in restaurants, bars, fitness centers, or movie theaters. Being on trains, buses, in airports, or using public transportation. Traveling on a cruise ship or river boat.

The following activities can put you at higher risk for COVID-19: Do your plans include traveling by bus, train, or air which might make staying 6 feet apart difficult?

Are you traveling with people who don’t live with you?

If the answer to any of these questions is “yes,” you should consider making other plans, such as delaying your travel.

If You Decide to Travel

Travel may increase your chance of spreading and getting COVID-19. Postponing travel and staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. If you do decide to travel, be sure to take these steps during your trip to protect yourself and others from COVID-19:

Check travel restrictions before you go.

Get your flu shot before you travel.

Bring extra supplies, such as masks and hand sanitizer.

Know when to delay your travel. Do not travel if you or your travel companions are sick.

Wear a mask to keep your nose and mouth covered when in public settings, including on public transportation and in transportation hubs such as airports and stations.

Avoid close contact by staying at least 6 feet apart (about 2 arm lengths) from anyone who is not from your travel group.

Wash your hands often or use hand sanitizer (with at least 60% alcohol).

Avoid contact with anyone who is sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

Consider testing

Testing could improve traveler safety.

The safest thing to do is to stay home, but if you do decide to travel, testing can help you do so more safely. You and your travel companions (including children) may feel well and not have any symptoms, but you can still spread COVID-19 to others in busy travel environments like in airports, and bus and train stations. You can also spread it to family, friends, and your community after travel. Testing does not eliminate all risk, but it can help make travel safer.

If you are traveling, consider getting tested with a viral test 1-3 days before your trip. Also consider getting tested with a viral test 3-5 days after your trip and reduce non-essential activities for a full 7 days after travel, even if your test is negative. If you don’t get tested, consider reducing non-essential activities for 10 days after travel.

Keep a copy of your test results with you during travel; you may be asked for them.

Do not travel if you test positive ; immediately isolate yourself, and follow public health recommendations.

; immediately isolate yourself, and follow public health recommendations. You may have been exposed to COVID-19 on your travels. You and your travel companions (including children) may pose a risk to your family, friends, and community. Regardless of where you traveled or what you did during your trip, take these actions to protect others from getting COVID-19 for 14 days after travel: Stay at least 6 feet/2 meters (about 2 arm lengths) from anyone who did not travel with you, particularly in crowded areas. It’s important to do this everywhere — both indoors and outdoors.

Considerations for Types of Travel

Travel increases your chances of spreading and getting COVID-19. Some travel activities, like the transportation you choose and where you stay, can increase your risk of getting COVID-19. Know your travel risk. Your chances of getting COVID-19 while traveling also depends on whether you and those around you take steps to protect yourselves and others, such as wearing masks and staying 6 feet away from people outside your travel group (social distancing). Airports, bus stations, train stations, and rest stops are all places travelers can be exposed to the virus in the air and on surfaces. These are also places where it can be hard to social distance. In general, the longer you are around a person with COVID-19, the more likely you are to get infected.

Air travel Air travel requires spending time in security lines and airport terminals, which can bring you in close contact with other people and frequently touched surfaces. Most viruses and other germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air is circulated and filtered on airplanes. However, social distancing is difficult on crowded flights and sitting within 6 feet of others, sometimes for hours, may increase your risk of getting COVID-19. How you get to and from the airport, such as with public transportation and ridesharing, can also increase your chances of being exposed to the virus. Bus or train travel Traveling on buses and trains for any length of time can involve being in crowded terminals and sitting or standing within 6 feet of others, which may increase your risk of getting COVID-19. If you choose to travel by bus or train, learn what you can do to protect yourself on public transportation. Car travel Making stops along the way for gas, food, or bathroom breaks can put you and your traveling companions in close contact with other people and frequently touched surfaces. RV travel You may have to stop less often for food or bathroom breaks, but RV travel usually means staying at RV parks overnight and getting gas and supplies at other public places. These stops may put you and those with you in the RV in close contact with others. Learn more about how to protect yourself from COVID-19 on different types of transportation.

How Are Transportation Companies Protecting Customers from COVID-19? When planning travel, you may want to check transportation companies’ websites to see what they are doing to protect customers from COVID-19. Things to look for include: Requiring people to wear a mask.

Promoting social distancing.

Using online or contactless reservations and check-in.

Using contactless payment.

Enhanced cleaning procedures.

Considerations for Staying with Family or Friends

If you, someone you live with, or anyone you plan to visit is at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, consider staying in a separate accommodation like a hotel, guest house, or short-stay rental.

Tips for staying overnight or hosting overnight guests

Be prepared. Know what you will do if you or someone else becomes sick during the visit. What are your plans for isolation, medical care, basic care, and travel home when it is safe to do so?

Wear masks while in shared spaces inside the house. Masks may be removed for eating, drinking, and sleeping, but individuals from different households should stay at least 6 feet away from each other at all times.

Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially upon arrival.

Visitors should launder clothing and masks and stow luggage away from common areas upon arrival.

Improve ventilation by opening windows and doors or by placing central air and heating on continuous circulation.

Spend time together outdoors. Take a walk or sit outdoors at least 6 feet apart for interpersonal interactions.

Avoid singing or shouting, especially indoors.

Treat pets as you would other human family members – do not let pets interact with people outside the household.

Monitor hosts and guests for symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath.

Tips to avoid getting and spreading COVID-19 in common travel situations:

In public:

Bathrooms and rest stops:

Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after using the bathroom and after you have been in a public place.

If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

Getting gas:

Use disinfecting wipes on handles and buttons at the gas pumps before you touch them (if available).

After fueling, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. When you get to your destination, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

Hotels and accommodations:

496,"When to Delay your Travel

The COVID-19 pandemic may be stressful for people. Traveling with or to visit family or friends can be a stress reliever, but it also increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19. You don’t want to miss out on a planned trip, but there are situations when cancelling or postponing travel makes sense for you and those you care about. Delaying your trip when you could spread COVID-19 also protects other travelers, people who work in travel settings, and those at your destination.

Check these common scenarios to see if you or your travel companions should delay your travel. This list does not include all possible situations. Talk to your health care provider before you travel if you are unsure whether any of these situations apply to you or your travel companions. CDC will continue to update this information as we learn more about COVID-19.

497,"Travel increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19. Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.

Some travel activities, like the transportation you choose and where you stay, can increase your risk of getting COVID-19. Your chances of exposure are higher if you come into close contact with others, especially people you don’t know, or use shared public facilities (like restrooms). COVID-19 is spreading in the United States and in many international destinations. Visiting locations where there are fewer cases of COVID-19 may be less risky for getting COVID-19 than visiting locations where there are more cases of COVID-19.

Before you travel, learn which travel activities are lower risk to protect yourself and others. Keep in mind that getting from one place to another is just one piece of the travel risk. Your activities and who you interact with before, during, and after travel may increase your risk.

Transportation

Your chances of getting COVID-19 while traveling depends not only on the length of the trip and the number of stops, but also on whether you and those around you take precautions, such as wearing masks and staying at least 6 feet away from other people. Airports, bus stations, train stations, and rest stops are all places travelers can be exposed to the virus through respiratory droplets or on surfaces. These are also places where it can be hard to keep your distance. In general, the longer you are around a person with COVID-19 (even if they do not have symptoms), the more likely you are to get infected.

When traveling on any public transportation, wear a mask for the duration of your trip, including while waiting in transportation hubs (airports, bus or ferry terminals, train or subway stations, seaports, or similar areas), while on public transportation conveyances (e.g., airplanes, ships, ferries, trains, subways, buses, taxis, ride-shares), and at your destination.

During car travel, making stops along the way for gas, food, or bathroom breaks can put you and your traveling companions in close contact with other people and frequently touched surfaces. If traveling in a RV, you may have to stop less often for food or bathroom breaks, but you could still be in close contact with others while staying at RV parks overnight and while getting gas and supplies at public places.

Traveling on buses and trains for any length of time can involve sitting or standing within 6 feet of others, which may increase your risk of getting COVID-19. If you choose to travel by bus or train, learn what you can do to protect yourself on public transportation.

Air travel requires spending time in security lines and airport terminals, which can bring you in close contact with other people and frequently touched surfaces. Most viruses and other germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes. However, keeping your distance is difficult on crowded flights, and sitting within 6 feet of others, sometimes for hours, may increase your risk of getting COVID-19.

Travel may increase your chance of spreading and getting COVID-19. CDC continues to recommend postponing travel and staying home, as this is the best way to protect yourself and others this year.

If you are considering traveling for the winter holidays, here are some important questions to ask yourself and your loved ones beforehand. These questions can help you decide what is best for you and your family.

Are you, someone in your household, or someone you will be visiting at increased risk for getting very sick from COVID-19?

Are cases high or increasing in your community or at your destination? The more cases in your community or at your destination, the more likely you are to get and spread COVID-19 as a result of your door-to-door travel. Check CDC’s COVID Data Tracker for the latest number of cases in each area.

Are hospitals in your community or at your destination overwhelmed with patients who have COVID-19? To find out, check state and local public health department websites.

Does your home or destination have requirements or restrictions for travelers? Check state and local requirements before you travel.

During the 14 days before your travel, have you or those you are visiting had close contact with people they don’t live with?

Do your plans include traveling by bus, train, or airplane, which might make staying 6 feet apart difficult?

Are you traveling with people who don’t live with you?

If the answer to any of these questions is “yes,” you should consider making other plans, such as hosting a virtual gathering or delaying your travel.

The following information aims to help people in the groups listed below make an informed decision about receiving the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.

People who have weakened immune systems

People with HIV and those with weakened immune systems due to other illnesses or medication might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19. They may receive a COVID-19 vaccine. However, they should be aware of the limited safety data:

Information about the safety of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines for people who have weakened immune systems in this group is not yet available.

People living with HIV were included in clinical trials, though safety data specific to this group are not yet available at this time.

People with weakened immune systems should also be aware of the potential for reduced immune responses to the vaccine, as well as the need to continue following all current guidance to protect themselves against COVID-19 (see below).

People who have autoimmune conditions

People with autoimmune conditions may receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. However, they should be aware that no data are currently available on the safety of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines for them. Individuals from this group were eligible for enrollment in clinical trials.

People who have previously had Guillain-Barre syndrome

Persons who have previously had GBS may receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. To date, no cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) have been reported following vaccination among participants in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials. With few exceptions, the independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) general best practice guidelines for immunization do not include a history of GBS as a precaution to vaccination with other vaccines.

People who have previously had Bell’s palsy

Cases of Bell’s palsy were reported in participants in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not consider these to be above the rate expected in the general population. They have not concluded these cases were caused by vaccination. Therefore, persons who have previously had Bell’s Palsy may receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.

After vaccination, current guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19 should be followed

This Order will go into effect at 7:01pm EST on December 27, 2020 (12:01am GMT on December 28, 2020).

Frequently Asked Questions

Does this requirement apply to US citizens?

This Order applies to all air passengers traveling from the UK to the US, including US citizens and legal permanent residents.

Can foreign nationals now enter the US from UK with a negative test?

With specific exceptions, foreign nationals who have been in the UK during the past 14 days may not enter the US, even with a negative test result. For more information, visit: Proclamation on the Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Certain Additional Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting Coronavirus | The White Houseexternal icon

When do I need to get a test to travel from the UK to the US? And what kind of test do I need?

Get tested no more than 3 days before your flight to the US from the UK departs. Make sure to be tested with a viral test (NAAT or antigen test) to determine if you are currently infected with COVID-19. Also make sure that you receive your results before your flight departs and have documentation of your results to show the airline.

Does this requirement apply if I have a layover in the UK?

No, this requirement does not apply to people with layovers of less than 24 hours in the UK.

Does this requirement apply if my travel started in the UK, but my flight to the US has a layover in another country/I’m transiting through another country on my way to the US?

If your travel starts in the UK, you are required to test negative for COVID-19 before travelling to the US.

Who is checking to make sure that people have a negative test before they board a plane in the UK?

The airline will confirm a COVID-19 negative test result for all passengers before boarding.

What happens if I don’t take a test and want to travel to the US from the UK?

Air passengers traveling from the UK to the US are required to have a negative COVID-19 test result. Airlines must confirm the negative test result for all passengers before boarding. If a passenger chooses not to take a test, the airline must deny boarding to the passenger.

What happens if I test positive?

People should self-isolate and delay their travel if symptoms develop or a pre-departure test result is positive. Airlines must refuse to board anyone who does not provide a negative test result for COVID-19.

What is a verifiable test result?

A verifiable test result must be in the form of written documentation (paper or electronic copy) of a laboratory test result. Testing must be performed using a viral test (NAAT or antigen), and negative results must be provided to the airline prior to boarding. The test result documentation must include information that identifies the person, a specimen collection date showing test was done within the 3 days before the flight, the type of test, and a negative result.

Do I need to get another test when I get to the United States?

CDC recommends that travelers get tested 3-5 days after travel AND stay home or otherwise self-quarantine for 7 days after travel. Even if you test negative, stay home for the full 7 days. If you don’t get tested, it’s safest to stay home for 10 days. Always follow state and local recommendations or requirements related to travel.

Remember to wear a mask, stay at least 6 feet apart from people who are not in your household, and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing and before eating. Look for symptoms of COVID-19, and take your temperature if you feel sick.

Watch for symptoms of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) such as cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever, chills, muscle pain, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell.

Do not go to work if you have any of the above symptoms.

If you are sick with COVID-19 or think you have COVID-19, you should isolate (separate yourself from others in a separate room) and follow CDC-recommended steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Isolation keeps someone who is infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, away from others, even in their home.

If you have had close contact to a person with COVID-19 (within six feet for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period), you should quarantine* for 14 days after last exposure. (Although CDC continues to recommend a 14-day quarantine, options are provided to shorten the quarantine period to after Day 7 or after Day 10 based on certain conditions, including test results.) Quarantine keeps someone who might have been exposed to the virus away from others: Stay home for 14 days (see above) after last contact with the confirmed COVID-19 case. Maintain social distance (at least six feet from other people). Self-monitor for symptoms (check temperature twice a day, watch for fever (feeling feverish or a measured temperature of 4°F or higher), cough, or shortness of breath). Avoid contact with people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 such as older adults and people with medical conditions. Contact your human resource and/or worker health unit coordinator.



Cleaning, Disinfection, and Sanitation

Practice hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette, and cleaning and disinfection.

Use soap, water, and paper towels for frequently washing your hands (at least 20 seconds). Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol frequently, when handwashing is not readily available. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your upper sleeves when you cough or sneeze. Avoid sharing objects and equipment with other employees, including phones, desks, or other workbenches, tools and equipment, when possible. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces, like shared tools, machines, vehicles and other equipment, handrails, ladders, doorknobs, and portable toilets. Surfaces that are visibly dirty should be cleaned with soap and water before disinfection.



Social Distancing and Face Masks

Utilize social distancing guidelines and face masks guidelines: Maintain at least six feet distance (about 2 arms’ length) between workers, wherever possible. Maintain social distancing during breaks and when eating. Avoid enclosed areas like trailers and tight/confined spaces. Wear face masks in worksites, especially when social distancing is difficult to maintain. Wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth for maximum protection (Don’t put the mask around your neck or up on your forehead). Don’t touch the outside of the mask when wearing it, and, if you do, wash your hands or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol to disinfect. Be careful not to touch your eyes, nose, and mouth when removing your mask and wash hands immediately after removing unless hands have been recently washed. Face masks are not replacements for respiratory protection when respirators are required.



Mental Health

Recognize factors that can add work- or home-related stress. Common factors that can add to stress during a pandemic: Concern about the risk of being exposed to the virus at work. Lack of access to the tools and equipment needed to perform your job. Conflict at home Failure to take time to relax Feelings that you are not contributing enough to work or guilt about not being on the frontline. Uncertainty about the future of your workplace and/or employment. Adapting to a different workspace and/or work schedule. Some ways to address stress and build resilience include:

Keep a regular sleep schedule external icon . Take breaks from work to stretch, exercise, or check in with supportive colleagues, coworkers, family, and friends. Spend time outdoors, either being physically active or relaxing. Practice mindfulness techniques external icon . Know the facts about COVID-19. Be informed about how to protect yourself and others. Understanding the risk and sharing accurate information with people you care about can reduce stress and help you make a connection with others. Connect with others. Talk with people you trust about your concerns, how you are feeling, or how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting you. Also considering using employee assistance programs or other resources that may be available to you.

513,"Over 81,000 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United States in the 12 months ending in May 2020, the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a 12-month period, according to recent provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

While overdose deaths were already increasing in the months preceding the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the latest numbers suggest an acceleration of overdose deaths during the pandemic.

“The disruption to daily life due to the COVID-19 pandemic has hit those with substance use disorder hard,” said CDC Director Robert Redfield, M.D. “As we continue the fight to end this pandemic, it’s important to not lose sight of different groups being affected in other ways. We need to take care of people suffering from unintended consequences.”

Synthetic opioids (primarily illicitly manufactured fentanyl) appear to be the primary driver of the increases in overdose deaths, increasing 38.4 percent from the 12-month period leading up to June 2019 compared with the 12-month period leading up to May 2020. During this time period:

37 of the 38 U.S. jurisdictions with available synthetic opioid data reported increases in synthetic opioid-involved overdose deaths.

18 of these jurisdictions reported increases greater than 50 percent.

10 western states reported over a 98 percent increase in synthetic opioid-involved deaths.

Overdose deaths involving cocaine also increased by 26.5 percent. Based upon earlier research, these deaths are likely linked to co-use or contamination of cocaine with illicitly manufactured fentanyl or heroin. Overdose deaths involving psychostimulants, such as methamphetamine, increased by 34.8 percent. The number of deaths involving psychostimulants now exceeds the number of cocaine-involved deaths.

“The increase in overdose deaths is concerning.” said Deb Houry, M.D., M.P.H., director of CDC’s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. “CDC’s Injury Center continues to help and support communities responding to the evolving overdose crisis. Our priority is to do everything we can to equip people on the ground to save lives in their communities.”

CDC recommendations

The increase in overdose deaths highlights the need for essential services to remain accessible for people most at risk of overdose and the need to expand prevention and response activities. CDC issued a health advisory today to medical and public health professionals, first responders, harm reduction organizations, and other community partners recommending the following actions as appropriate based on local needs and characteristics:

Expand distribution and use of naloxone and overdose prevention education.

Expand awareness about and access to and availability of treatment for substance use disorders.

Intervene early with individuals at highest risk for overdose.

Improve detection of overdose outbreaks to facilitate more effective response.

What CDC is doing

Measures taken at the national, state, and local level to address the COVID-19 pandemic may have unintended consequences for substance use and overdose, but CDC is working with states, territories, tribes, cities, and counties across the country to continue drug overdose surveillance and prevention efforts. This includes assessing overdose data to understand trends, as well as working with funded jurisdictions to provide flexibilities where needed and technical assistance to identify strategies to inform public health action during the COVID-19 pandemic.

CDC began a multiyear Overdose Data to Action cooperative agreement in September 2019 and funds health departments in 47 states; Washington, D.C.; two territories; and 16 cities and counties for drug overdose surveillance and prevention efforts. Funds awarded as part of this agreement support health departments in obtaining high quality, more comprehensive, and timelier data on overdose morbidity and mortality and using those data to inform prevention and response efforts.

CDC is committed to preventing opioid and other drug misuse, overdoses, and deaths through five key strategies:

Using data to monitor emerging trends and direct prevention activities;

Strengthening state, local, and tribal capacity to respond to the epidemic;

Working with providers, health systems, and payers to reduce unsafe exposure to opioids and treat addiction;

Coordinating with public safety and community-based partners to rapidly identify overdose threats, reverse overdoses, link people to effective treatment, and reduce harms associated with illicit opioids; and

Increasing public awareness about the risks of opioids.

For decades, the UK’s fishing fleet has been subject to the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).

The CFP allocates fishing rights among the EU’s 22 coastal states.

According to international law, a coastal nation’s fisheries should extend 200 nautical miles from its coastline or to a maritime halfway point, as part of an area known as the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

Outside the EU, the UK will become an independent coastal state, regaining control of its EEZ, but, as part of the trade deal, negotiators have been deciding how much fish EU boats should be allowed to catch in UK waters in future.

In 2018, EU-27 vessels caught 863,000 tonnes of fish - worth around £580m - in UK waters, while UK vessels landed 555,000 tonnes (including fish which were worth more), valued at £827m, in the same year.

Fishing only accounts for about 0.02% of the UK economy, but it was an important part of the Leave campaign in 2016, with many British fishermen keen for the UK to control its waters.

572,"New coronavirus variant: What do we know? By James Gallagher

Health and science correspondent Published duration 6 days ago

The rapid spread of a new variant of coronavirus has been blamed for the introduction of strict tier four mixing rules for millions of people, harsher restrictions on mixing at Christmas in England, Scotland and Wales, and other countries placing the UK on a travel ban.

So how has it gone from being non-existent to the most common form of the virus in parts of England in a matter of months?

The government's advisers on new infections now say they have ""high"" confidence that it is more able to transmit than other variants.

All the work is at an early stage, contains huge uncertainties and a long list of unanswered questions.

As I've written before, viruses mutate all the time and it's vital to keep a laser focus on whether the virus' behaviour is changing.

Why is this variant causing concern?

Three things are coming together that mean it is attracting attention:

It is rapidly replacing other versions of the virus

It has mutations that affect part of the virus likely to be important

Some of those mutations have already been shown in the lab to increase the ability of the virus to infect cells

All of these come together to build a case for a virus that can spread more easily.

However, we do not have absolute certainty. New strains can become more common simply by being in the right place at the right time - such as London, which had only tier two restrictions until recently.

But already the justification for tier four restrictions is in part to reduce the spread of the variant.

""Laboratory experiments are required, but do you want to wait weeks or months [to see the results and take action to limit the spread]? Probably not in these circumstances,"" Prof Nick Loman, from the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium, told me.

How much faster is it spreading?

It was first detected in September. In November around a quarter of cases in London were the new variant. This reached nearly two-thirds of cases in mid-December.

You can see how the variant has come to dominate the results of testing in some centres such as the Milton Keynes Lighthouse Laboratory.

View original tweet on Twitter

Mathematicians have been running the numbers on the spread of different variants in an attempt to calculate how much of an edge this one might have.

But teasing apart what is due to people's behaviour and what is due to the virus is hard.

The figure mentioned by Prime Minister Boris Johnson was that the variant may be up to 70% more transmissible. He said this may be increasing the R number - which indicates if an epidemic is growing or shrinking - by 0.4.

That 70% number appeared in a presentation by Dr Erik Volz, from Imperial College London, on Friday.

During the talk he said: ""It is really too early to tell… but from what we see so far it is growing very quickly, it is growing faster than [a previous variant] ever grew, but it is important to keep an eye on this.""

There is no ""nailed on"" figure for how much more infectious the variant may be. Scientists, whose work is not yet public, have told me figures both much higher and much lower than 70%.

But there remain questions about whether it is any more infectious at all.

""The amount of evidence in the public domain is woefully inadequate to draw strong or firm opinions on whether the virus has truly increased transmission,"" said Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham.

How far has it spread?

It is thought the variant either emerged in a patient in the UK or has been imported from a country with a lower ability to monitor coronavirus mutations.

The variant can be found across the UK, except Northern Ireland, but it is heavily concentrated in London, the South East and eastern England. Cases elsewhere in the country do not seem to have taken off.

Data from Nextstrain, which has been monitoring the genetic codes of the viral samples around the world, suggest cases in Denmark and Australia have come from the UK. The Netherlands has also reported cases.

For the UK variant:

Outside of the UK, we see very small numbers of sequences in Denmark (a bit hard to see - hidden behind UK circle) & Australia. Their position on the tree indicates that they're likely exports from the UK.

A similar variant that has emerged in South Africa shares some of the same mutations, but appears to be unrelated to this one.

Has this happened before?

Yes.

The virus that was first detected in Wuhan, China, is not the same one you will find in most corners of the world.

The D614G mutation emerged in Europe in February and became the globally dominant form of the virus.

Another, called A222V, spread across Europe and was linked to people's summer holidays in Spain.

What do we know about the new mutations?

An initial analysis of the new variant has been published and identifies 17 potentially important alterations.

There have been changes to the spike protein - this is the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway to our body's cells.

One mutation called N501Y alters the most important part of the spike, known as the ""receptor-binding domain"".

This is where the spike makes first contact with the surface of our body's cells. Any changes that make it easier for the virus to get inside are likely to give it an edge.

""It looks and smells like an important adaptation,"" said Prof Loman.

The other mutation - a H69/V70 deletion, in which a small part of the spike is removed - has emerged several times before, including famously in infected mink.

Work by Prof Ravi Gupta at the University of Cambridge has suggested this mutation increases infectivity two-fold in lab experiments.

Studies by the same group suggest the deletion makes antibodies from the blood of survivors less effective at attacking the virus.

Prof Gupta told me: ""It is rapidly increasing, that's what's worried government, we are worried, most scientists are worried.""

Where has it come from?

The variant is unusually highly mutated.

The most likely explanation is the variant has emerged in a patient with a weakened immune system that was unable to beat the virus.

Instead their body became a breeding ground for the virus to mutate.

Does it make the infection more deadly?

There is no evidence to suggest that it does, although this will need to be monitored.

However, just increasing transmission would be enough to cause problems for hospitals.

If the new variant means more people are infected more quickly, that would in turn lead to more people needing hospital treatment.

Will the vaccines work against the new variant?

Almost certainly yes, or at least for now.

All three leading vaccines develop an immune response against the existing spike, which is why the question comes up.

Vaccines train the immune system to attack several different parts of the virus, so even though part of the spike has mutated, the vaccines should still work.

""But if we let it add more mutations, then you start worrying,"" said Prof Gupta.

""This virus is potentially on a pathway for vaccine escape, it has taken the first couple of steps towards that.""

Vaccine escape happens when the virus changes so it dodges the full effect of the vaccine and continues to infect people.

This may be the most concerning element of what is happening with the virus.

This variant is just the latest to show the virus is continuing to adapt as it infects more and more of us.

A presentation by Prof David Robertson, from the University of Glasgow on Friday, concluded: ""The virus will probably be able to generate vaccine escape mutants.""

That would put us in a position similar to flu, where the vaccines need to be regularly updated. Fortunately the vaccines we have are very easy to tweak.",https://www.bbc.com/news/coronavirus

Many of us are relieved to have ditched office commutes amid Covid-19, but what some see as a grind, others view as a ritual. For Nils Backhaus, who lives in Bochum, just outside Dortmund in Germany, even when he’s working from home commuting is still an essential part of his day that he can’t go without. At the end of the working day, around the time of 1700, the 34-year-old research and policy adviser for Germany’s Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health puts on his shoes, and gets on his racing bike to cruise through the tranquil landscapes along the Ruhr River.

This daily ride – what he calls his “fake commute” – mimics the trip he used to take returning from the office, before he transitioned to home working. It’s Backhaus’s way of recreating a more traditional start to ‘Feierabend’, a German word describing the time after work is done, and a period of leisure and rest begins.

“‘Feierabend’ has two meanings,” says Christoph Stengel, a 41-year-old Berliner who works as a software developer at price-comparison website Idealo. “First, it's the moment you stop working for the rest of the day – of course, [it’s] a good feeling then. Second, it's the part of the day between work and going to bed.”

It might seem surprising that Germans, who are often stereotyped as hard, efficient workers, cherish their leisure time so protectively. But the concept of Feierabend is also linked to a very capitalist mentality that companies get more productivity – and therefore more value – out of their labour force if workers are allowed clear periods of rest after work.

“You have to rest after work directly, you can’t do double time the next day,” says Backhaus. “The stress and recovery go hand in hand. It’s like a bodily rhythm.”",https://www.bbc.com

Many a conversation in France begins with a sigh and a lament: the weather is bad; the grape harvest is worse; politicians are inept and stupid to boot. When I first moved to France more than a decade ago as a starry-eyed 19-year-old American, I was disquieted by this constant barrage of complaints. Why, I wondered, were the French always in such a bad mood? But when I finally got up the courage to ask a French friend, he baulked: they weren’t complainers, he said. They were râleurs.

In France, there are several words for “to complain”: there’s “se plaindre”, used for regular old complaining; there’s “porter plainte”, for complaining more officially. And then there’s “râler”: complaining just for the fun of it.

“Râleris informal, even curmudgeonly (think “grumble” or “grouch”),” explained Dr Gemma King, senior lecturer in French at the Australian National University and editor of the blog Les Musées de Paris. “You might râler about doing something but still do it (albeit begrudgingly), whereas porter plainte implies you will not be doing something and someone will be hearing about why.”

When I was still in the throes of applying for French residency permits, and French citizenship was still a lofty dream, I used to joke that I would know I was truly French before receiving the confirmation letter because I would certainly waken with the uncontrollable urge to moan and groan. In preparation for that fateful day, I would mock-whine to anyone who would listen:the soup is too cold; the salad is too warm; a neighbour neglected to say “bonjour” to me.

But while my friends laughed at my attempts to sigh like a French person, it was a bit, I imagine, like watching a child who has yet to fully grasp language pretend to talk on the phone. The appropriateness of when, to whom and about what to râle is a delicate art, and one that I had yet to fully master.

In France, a complaint is an appropriate – and frequent – conversation starter. One could begin talking about a restaurant by focusing on the poor service during an otherwise great meal, or highlight the fact that the east-facing windows in your new flat mean you now have to buy curtains. But while, as Julie Barlow, Canadian journalist and co-author of The Bonjour Effect, explained, “To Americans, saying something negative sounds like you’re closing the conversation”, in France, such comments are perceived as “a way to invite other people’s opinions”. North Americans, she said, are not as comfortable with confrontation – or with criticism – as the French are. Râler, then, “comes across as something that’s more intelligent than being too starry-eyed and optimistic about things”.

Anna Polonyi, a Franco-Hungarian-American writer and head of the creative writing department at the Paris Institute for Critical Thinking, posited that this distinction may stem from a core fear shared by many Americans: that of being perceived as “a loser”.

“There’s no word for that, in France,” she said. “In order to be a loser, the world around you needs to think of things in terms of winning. And I’m not sure that that’s necessarily how people see social interactions [here].”

In France, conversations could instead be likened to “duels,” according to Barlow, and the opening punch may well be a complaint – a display of demonstrable intellect, “something that makes people seem critical and like they’re thinking and not naïve”.

Polonyi experienced this first-hand when she moved from France, where she was raised, to Iowa. There, she noticed, people kept themselves from negative speech as long as they could, only unleashing a barrage of complaints when it had built up far beyond what they could stand.

“It wasn’t complaining the way that we knew it; it was venting,” she said. “It felt like people weren’t giving themselves permission to complain in a way that actually built intimacy. They were just sort of not doing it until it was impossible not to.”

Polonyi even found herself picking up on an American tic: concluding her complaining with an addendum. “When I complain in English, it gets slotted into this narrative,” she said. “I have a certain expectation that at the end of that conversation I need to be like, ‘Oh, but I’m gonna get through it!’.”

I think the French are optimistic and positive about themselves and their lives, but they tend to be really hard on their country

In French, on the contrary, there is no need for a conclusion. “I feel like the more specifically I can complain, the more I can move the other person to feel sort of empathetic about how horrible something is,” she said.

The French attitude towards complaining is uncomfortable for many Anglophones, many of whom argue that negativity breeds negativity. But according to some experts, the French attitude may in fact be better for your health. A 2013 study in Biological Psychiatry found that attempts to regulate negative emotions could be linked with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, while 2011 study from the University of Texas at Austin found that bottling up negative emotions can make people more aggressive.

This isn’t to say that complaining is always positive. Complaining too often can get you caught in a spiral, actually rewiring your brain to always focus on the negative. But French râleurs may well avoid this unfortunate side effect, in part because they rarely complain about their own lives but rather about external issues.

According to a poll on the practice, 48% of French people surveyed said that the thing that they complained about most was the government. It’s perhaps no surprise then, according to a recent article in Politico, that the French opinion of President Emmanuel Macron’s handling of the pandemic was overwhelmingly negative. Personal issues, meanwhile, are very low on the list of things the French choose to râle about, according to the poll, with 23% complaining when people don’t call them back, 33% complaining when they can’t find their keys or phone and only 12% complaining about issues linked to their children.

“I think the French are optimistic and positive about themselves and their lives, but they tend to be really hard on their country,” said Barlow. “Don’t go to a party and praise France; people will laugh at you.”

According to Margot Bastin, a researcher at Belgian university Katholieke Universiteit Leuven who has published peer-reviewed papers on the effects of internalising negative emotions, the fact that the French focus on issues that are “not personal, not related to themselves” may indeed be healthier. But Bastin’s research has also found that while a certain amount of venting can be helpful, it is “detrimental [when it] becomes a very prolonged process, when it happens excessively”.

If someone’s complaining, I feel like there’s authenticity there

But the French on the whole, do not tend to catastrophise – nor, as Polonyi noticed, rarely does their complaining even have a goal of resolution. While there’s no dearth of Americans wanting to speak to a manager to right a wrong or Brits audibly sighing when someone is queuing improperly, in France, complaining is not seen as a means to an end.

“I don’t think that they’re complaining because they necessarily want to change anything,” said Barlow. “I think it’s a cultural, conversational tic.”

As with most conversational tics – like asking how someone is without actually caring to know the answer – complaining in France is above all a means of forging interpersonal connection. And it’s an apt one. One study conducted at the University of Oklahoma showed that complaining may have a positive impact on connectivity; and research also shows that it can be a useful tool for bonding.

“The other person is listening to you, you really feel connected with the other person, you really feel close to the other person, you feel understood,” said Bastin.

To wit, I never felt more French as when I left a scenario that only served to highlight my foreignness: going to the police prefecture to renew my residency card. After a truly Kafka-esque journey through the bowels of the bureaucratic office, I complained to anyone who would listen, painting a portrait of the ineptitude of those in charge, of obsoleteness of the list of documents I had been asked to prepare.

And while my French friends did not share this specific experience, they used it as a jumping-off point for complaints of their own: experiences with the tax office or zoning department, where other bureaucrats threw other wrenches in other wheels. It was, apparently, a common complaint.

After years of living in France, I was finally building intimacy with locals; I just hadn’t known I would have to complain so much to get there.

“If someone’s complaining, I feel like there’s authenticity there,” Polonyi said, “and I’m reassured by that authenticity. Because I feel like, in a way, complaining is, in some sense, being vulnerable.”

""That emotion was a whisper at first, then it was a roar. That man had this fight in him to the very end.""

On 28 August 2020, Chadwick Boseman passed away having been diagnosed with colon cancer four years earlier, and the world gasped with grief; he had never revealed his diagnosis publicly, or even to his work colleagues. Boseman was a symbol of black excellence and of cinematic excellence, and at just 43 years old he was robbed of a future in which he was primed for even more professional success and personal fulfilment. He was a virtuoso and heroic figure, not just because of his iconic turn as Marvel's Black Panther but for how he raised the bar for racial equality and representation on screen. He was committed to this creative and cultural endeavour throughout his career and it's what makes his cinematic legacy awe-inspiring.

A hero from the beginning

From his earliest roles on screen, the South Carolina native wanted to combat the pejorative stereotyping of black people in popular culture. Aged 26, Boseman was fired by the producers of soap opera All My Children for raising concerns about his character Reggie being written as little more than a teen thug. As he told The Wrap in 2019, it was not part of his ""manifesto"" to play these types of damaging stereotypes – especially as a graduate of Howard University, a historically black institution that had ""instilled in [him] a certain amount of pride,"" as he made clear during a speech at its commencement ceremony in 2018. The role ""didn't live up to those standards"" so he shared his opinion with the producers and they recast him with a then-16-year-old Michael B Jordan. ""They said, 'You are too much trouble, ' but they took my suggestions, or some of them,"" Boseman told The Wrap. ""And for me, honestly, that’s what this is about.""",https://www.bbc.com

615,"The eyes of future historians are on us now. The year 2020 has been tumultuous, disruptive, exhausting, and pivotal – and one day, our great-grandchildren may wonder what it was like to live through these times. Yet with all that has happened over the past 12 months, only snapshots may be recorded in the long-term: the most salient traumas and the most dramatic turning points. History often charts the stories of the privileged, the powerful or the notorious, but cannot capture all of human experience.

So, what might we wish future generations to know about this year? If you could leave behind an object that spoke of 2020, what would it be?

As the year comes to an end, BBC Future decided to assemble a virtual time capsule – a list of objects that matter, and that tomorrow's generations should know about, 100 years from now.

Collaborating with the School of International Futures, we asked their network and global next-generation fellows to nominate a series of objects. To that list, we added a few extra submissions from other future thinkers – plus one or two of our own.

Some might wish to forget this year. However, the objects we collated are intended to be symbols of acts, experiences, ideas and changes that are worth preserving. We asked our submitters to propose items they believe deserve attention and memorialisation during these turbulent times. As well as the trauma, this year has also brought some positive changes that we don't want to lose, moments when things got a little bit better amid the chaos, local wisdom or inspiration, as well as warnings that we might hope will not be forgotten.

Time capsules have always been about what a society wishes to remember and pass on: its best version of itself, projected into the future. They are usually subjective, often eclectic, and always tell a human story. And that's exactly what we got when we asked for submissions.

Here's what we chose:",https://www.bbc.com/schoolreport

For nearly 10 years, I have spent my Monday evenings attending rehearsals for my amateur choir. Mondays are not my favourite day, and I often arrive in a bad mood, but by the end of the rehearsal, I usually feel energised. The singing does me good. So do the people. With a few exceptions, I wouldn’t describe my fellow choir members as close friends; most of them, I barely know at all. We exchange brief chats, smiles and the odd joke – but that’s enough for me to come away feeling a little better about the world.

There is no choir practice now, and won’t be for a long time. I miss it. In lockdown, I don’t feel short on affection or emotional support, but I do feel short of friendly faces and casual conversations. Another way of putting this is that I miss my weak ties.

In 1973, Mark Granovetter, a sociology professor at Stanford University, published a paper entitled The Strength of Weak Ties. It went on to become one of the most influential sociology papers of all time. Until then scholars had assumed that an individual’s well-being depended mainly on the quality of relationships with close friends and family. Granovetter showed that quantity matters, too.

One way to think about any person’s social world is that you have an inner circle of people whom you often talk to and feel close with, and an outer circle of acquaintances whom you see infrequently or fleetingly. Granovetter named these categories “strong ties” and “weak ties”. His central insight was that for new information and ideas, weak ties are more important to us than strong ones.

Granovetter surveyed 282 Boston-based workers and found that most of them got their jobs through someone they knew. But only a minority got the job through a close friend; 84% got their job through those weak-tie relationships – meaning casual contacts whom they saw only occasionally. As Granovetter pointed out, the people whom you spend a lot of time with swim in the same pool of information as you do. We depend on friendly outsiders to bring us news of opportunities from beyond our immediate circles – and so the more of those acquaintances we have, the better.",https://www.bbc.com/schoolreport

More areas of England face the toughest tier four Covid restrictions from Boxing Day.

Other parts of England also move to higher tiers, to curb the spread of a new variant of Covid-19.

Mainland Scotland and Northern Ireland start new lockdowns on Boxing Day. The whole of Wales has already entered lockdown.

What are the rules for Christmas?

People in tier four areas of England cannot travel elsewhere and are only allowed to celebrate Christmas with members of their own household and support bubbles.

Elsewhere in England - and in Scotland and Wales - joining other households in ""Christmas bubbles"" is allowed on Christmas Day only. In Northern Ireland one day between 23 and 27 December is allowed.

Exactly who can be in the temporary bubbles varies across the UK.

What are the Covid rules in England?

632,"Covid: How does mass testing work? By Ian Westbrook

BBC News Published duration 3 days ago

image copyright Getty Images

Mass testing is coming to be seen as a key part of stopping the spread of Covid.

The hope is that it can identify people who may be contagious - including those without symptoms.

It's being deployed to help the lorry drivers stranded in Kent and is going to be expanded in care homes.

What is mass testing and why is it important?

Mass testing makes it easier to find people who may be unaware that they are infected.

They can then be told to isolate and be prevented from spreading the virus.

Mass testing can also be used in more targeted ways, including:

Regular testing in a hospital or care home to prevent outbreaks

To keep open places such as schools and universities where the virus can spread

Helping people safely attend a cinema, theatre or football match with a one-off test before entry

What tests are being offered?

Pilot schemes have offered two types of testing, both involve swabbing the nose or throat.

The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test is regarded as the ""gold standard"" by epidemiologists, but takes up to a day or longer to produce a result because the sample is sent off to a laboratory.

The lateral flow test involves a handheld kit that gives a result - a bit like a pregnancy test - in about 20 minutes. There's no need for a lab. Fluid from a nasal swab or saliva goes on one end, then a marking appears if you are positive.

What happens if I test positive?

Anyone who tests positive must immediately self-isolate for at least 10 days. Their contacts will be traced by NHS Test and Trace, and must isolate if told to do so.

Self-isolating means staying at home and not leaving even to buy food, medicines or other essentials, or for exercise.

People should order online groceries, or ask friends and family to get supplies and leave them outside the front door.

Anyone in England who fails to self-isolate after a positive test can be fined up to £10,000.

Anyone on low income who has been told to self-isolate in a phone call from NHS Test and Trace, can claim a £500 payment from their local authority.

image copyright Getty Images image caption Mass testing is being carried out to ease the backlog of drivers stuck on their journey to France

How is it helping stranded lorry drivers?

Mass testing is being used to help clear long queues of lorries in Kent, after France shut its border to prevent the new coronavirus variant spreading.

Soldiers are working with NHS Test and Trace staff to give the lorry drivers lateral flow tests. They need proof of a negative test less than 72 hours before leaving for France, and will receive the result by text.

Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said it is likely to take ""a few days"" to clear the backlog.

Testing will happen at ""multiple"" sites at Manston Airport, where more than 3,000 lorries are being held, and elsewhere.

Any who test positive will be offered Covid-secure hotel accommodation and must self-isolate.

What's happening in schools?

Mass Covid testing of secondary school pupils in England is to be stepped up in January.

Staff will be offered a weekly test, and daily tests if they have had a case in their class.

Any pupil who has come into contact with a positive case will be offered daily tests for seven days. Previously, a whole bubble, class or year group might have been sent home.

Tests will be optional and require parental consent. Testing in primary schools could begin later in the term.

Children under 16 need to be accompanied by a parent or guardian to use a mobile testing unit.

Where else will mass testing be available?

Currently, most people can only have a test if they already have symptoms.

But under England's new, stricter tier system, the government want mass testing happening in areas with high infection rates.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said another £149m in funds will be invested into rapid testing in care homes.

Staff ""will receive two rapid tests a week in addition to their weekly PCR test"", he said.

This follows the success of Liverpool's scheme, where everyone living or working in the city was offered a voluntary test.

Cases there fell from 635 per 100,000 people in mid-October to 99 by mid-December.

How is mass testing in towns and cities carried out?

In addition to testing the general population, local authorities could also target high-risk workplaces and hard-to-reach communities.

This could be similar to the Liverpool pilot, which used mobile testing sites in care homes and schools.

640,"Coronavirus: What are the social distancing rules? Published duration 9 November

image copyright Getty Images

Social distancing remains a key part of the UK's strategy for keeping people safe and preventing the spread of Covid-19.

It means keeping a certain distance away from other people to lessen the risk of passing on - or catching - coronavirus.

What are the rules in each UK nation?

Each nation has slightly different advice:

In Scotland people should keep 2m away from each other. Shops are reintroducing measures to support 2m physical distancing, like one-way systems. There are exemptions in some places like pubs, and children aged 11 or under do not need to social distance

people should keep 2m away from each other. Shops are reintroducing measures to support 2m physical distancing, like one-way systems. There are exemptions in some places like pubs, and children aged 11 or under do not need to social distance In England , if you can't stay 2m away, you can stay ""1m plus"" apart (the ""plus"" means doing something else to limit possible exposure, like wearing a face covering)

, if you can't stay 2m away, you can stay ""1m plus"" apart (the ""plus"" means doing something else to limit possible exposure, like wearing a face covering) In Wales , the guidance is to stay 2m apart unless it is not practical (for instance, at a hairdresser's); primary-age children in Wales are also exempt

, the guidance is to stay 2m apart unless it is not practical (for instance, at a hairdresser's); primary-age children in Wales are also exempt Northern Ireland's guidance was 1m (3ft) for a time, but is now back at 2m

Social distancing is important because coronavirus spreads mainly when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks, and transmits small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air.

These droplets can land in other people's mouths or noses nearby or may be inhaled into the lungs. You could also be infected after touching a surface on which the droplets have landed.

The risks are far higher indoors than outdoors.

How can I meet other people safely and can we hug?

Social distancing is a key element of meeting others safely.

The only people you do not need to socially distance from are:

People in your household

Anyone in your support bubble, if you have one

Otherwise, when seeing anybody else you must:

Follow social distancing rules

Avoid physical contact like a handshake or hug

Not be too close or face-to-face

Not shout or sing too close to them

How many people can I meet?

Different restrictions apply across the UK.

England is currently under a national lockdown, during which nobody can meet anyone from outside their household or support bubble indoors. Children under five don't count.

They can meet one other person in an outdoor public place, such as a park.

Scotland is moving to a five-tier system of restrictions from Monday, with rules about meeting people different at each level.

The lockdown in Wales has now finished. Two households in Wales can now form a bubble and can meet in their own homes, while up to 15 people are allowed to meet for organised activities indoors, and up to 30 outdoors.

People living in Northern Ireland are also currently under restrictions. Support bubbles are limited to a maximum of 10 people from two households.

Are there any exceptions?

Exceptions to social distancing rules in England include:

A household or support bubble larger than six

Education and training

Workplaces

Jury duty or other legal commitments

Children's play groups and youth clubs

Health editor, BBC News online Published duration 12 November

image copyright Getty Images

Record numbers of Covid-19 cases are being confirmed across the UK. But given it's also the flu season, how can you be sure whether you have coronavirus, a cold or the flu?

They are all caused by different viruses, but can have similar symptoms.

Most people who feel ill with coronavirus will have at least one of these three key symptoms:

a high temperature

a new, continuous cough

a loss or change to their sense of smell or taste

So what do you need to know about other things you may catch in the coming months?

Does a fever mean I have coronavirus?

media caption A cold, flu or coronavirus - which one do I have?

A high temperature is 37.8C or above. A fever like this can happen when the body is fighting off any infection - not just coronavirus.

It is best to use a thermometer to take a measure. But if you don't have one, check if you, or the person you are worried about, feels hot to the touch on the chest or back.

Although fever is a key coronavirus symptom, it could be flu or a different infection.

A high temperature is unlikely with a cold.

If you have a fever, arrange a coronavirus test - you can use the NHS 111 coronavirus service online.

What about a cough?

If you have a cold or flu you may well have a cough, along with other symptoms.

Flu usually comes on suddenly and sufferers will often experience muscle aches, chills, headaches, tiredness, a sore throat and a runny or stuffed nose, along with the cough. It feels worse than a heavy cold.

Colds tend to develop more gradually and are less severe, although they do still make you feel unwell. Along with a cough, there may be sneezing and a sore throat and runny nose. Fever, chills, muscle aches and headaches are rare.

A coronavirus cough means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing fits or ""episodes"" in 24 hours.

If you usually have a cough because of a long-standing medical condition like COPD, it may be worse than usual.

You should get tested for coronavirus if you develop a new, continuous cough.

What do loss or change to smell or taste mean?

These are key symptoms of coronavirus and mean you should get a test.

It could still be that you have a simple cold. But you need to check, even if you don't feel unwell, to avoid the risk of spreading the virus.

Does sneezing mean I've got coronavirus?

Sneezing is not a symptom of coronavirus, and unless you also have a fever, cough or loss of smell and taste, you do not need a test.

Sneeze droplets can spread infections though, so catch them in a tissue, put it in the bin and then wash your hands.

Remember Hands. Face. Space to help stop the spread of coronavirus and other illnesses:

Wash your hands regularly

Use a face covering when social distancing is not possible

Try to keep your distance from those not in your household

More people in England are being offered a free flu jab this year too in the run-up to winter.

How about a runny or blocked nose?

As we head into winter and with children back to school and more workplaces open, lots of people will be getting colds.

A runny nose is not a reason to get tested for coronavirus, says NHS Scotland.

Data from an app that has been monitoring Covid-19 symptoms, reported by UK users, suggests children present less often with respiratory symptoms and are more likely to be suffering from fever, headaches, fatigue and skin rashes.

What if I am very unwell?

People with coronavirus have a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild to severe, although some will have none at all, but can still be infectious.

Symptoms may appear up to two weeks after exposure to coronavirus, but usually around day five.

Feeling breathless can be a sign of a more serious coronavirus infection.

If you are having trouble breathing, contact your doctor online or over the phone, or the NHS 111 online coronavirus service.

If you are very worried about sudden shortness of breath ring 999.

643,"Coronavirus: What are the rules for face masks or face coverings? By Michelle Roberts

Health editor, BBC News online Published duration 30 October

media caption How to wear your mask. Hint: it's not any of these three options

People around the UK must now wear face coverings in many public places.

But what protection do they offer, and what sort of coverings can be worn?

Why should we wear a face covering?

Face coverings reduce the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and speaking.

They should mainly be worn to protect other people from coronavirus, rather than yourself.

When worn correctly, they should cover the nose and mouth, which are the main confirmed sources of transmission.

They can help to reduce the spread of the virus from people who are contagious, including those who have no symptoms, or are yet to develop them.

There is also evidence they can offer some protection to the wearer, although they are not a replacement for social distancing and hand-washing.

Where must they be worn in the UK?

Face coverings are now compulsory across the UK when:

Travelling on public transport

In shops, supermarkets and shopping centres

Not seated at a table to eat or drink in hospitality venues

People can be refused travel for not following the rules or fined as a last resort. In England, the police can issue a £200 fine to someone breaking the face covering rules. In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, a £60 fine can be imposed. Repeat offenders face bigger fines.

In England and Scotland, face coverings are also compulsory in a number of indoor spaces, including:

Banks, building societies and post offices

Places of worship

Museums, galleries and entertainment venues

Libraries and public reading rooms

Scotland also requires face coverings to be worn in indoor spaces, such as staff canteens and corridors in workplaces. It no longer requires couples to wear them when exchanging marriage vows.

In Wales, face coverings must be worn in all indoor public places by customers and staff.

In Northern Ireland, they must be worn in ""any other indoor place where goods or services are available to buy or rent"".

Does everyone have to wear one?

Some people do not have to wear a face covering. They include:

Children (under 11 in England or Wales, under 13 in Northern Ireland, under five in Scotland)

Those unable to put on or wear a face covering because of a physical or mental illness or disability

People for whom wearing or removing a face covering will cause severe distress

Anyone assisting someone who relies on lip reading to communicate

You can remove your mask if:

You need to eat, drink, or take medication

A police officer or other official asks you to, or for shop staff to verify your age

You are entering a shop to avoid harm, if you do not have a mask on you

Young children should not wear face masks because of the risk of choking and suffocation.

image copyright PA Media

What are the face-covering rules in schools?

The government does not recommend wearing face coverings in schools and colleges because of the controls already in place.

However, each nation is adopting different rules:

In England, secondary schools will have the ''discretion'' to require face coverings in communal areas, where social distancing is not possible

The Scottish government says all secondary school pupils should wear face coverings in corridors and communal areas, and senior pupils (years S4-S6) and their teachers must wear them in class

In addition, all staff in Scottish schools must wear masks where social distancing is not possible

In Wales, face coverings are recommended in high schools when social distancing is ""unlikely to be maintained"", but are not compulsory

In Northern Ireland, face coverings must be worn in the corridors of post-primary schools

However, they will be mandatory for schools in parts of England that are under local restrictions, but not in classrooms.

media caption Stop your glasses steaming up with a mask on

Can I make one myself?

The BBC has created a guide on how to make your own face covering.

The government has issued its own advice too.

Do face coverings work?

Face coverings do not give the wearer as much protection as the masks that healthcare workers wear.

World Health Organization (WHO) advice says non-medical face coverings should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible.

For decades, the UK’s fishing fleet has been subject to the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).

The CFP allocates fishing rights among the EU’s 22 coastal states.

According to international law, a coastal nation’s fisheries should extend 200 nautical miles from its coastline or to a maritime halfway point, as part of an area known as the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

Outside the EU, the UK will become an independent coastal state, regaining control of its EEZ, but, as part of the trade deal, negotiators have been deciding how much fish EU boats should be allowed to catch in UK waters in future.

In 2018, EU-27 vessels caught 863,000 tonnes of fish - worth around £580m - in UK waters, while UK vessels landed 555,000 tonnes (including fish which were worth more), valued at £827m, in the same year.

image copyright Getty Images

Rules on travelling to and from European Union countries will change on 1 January 2021.

That's because an agreement between the UK and EU to keep many things the same - for 11 months after Brexit - comes to an end by then.

A post-Brexit deal between the UK and the EU has now been reached, with lots of new rules on trade and in other areas.

Can I go on holiday to the EU after 1 January?

At the moment, no.

Because of Covid, travellers from most non-EU countries can't visit except for essential reasons.

After 31 December, the UK will no longer be treated like a member of the EU, so becomes subject to these rules.

The only non-EU countries exempt from these restrictions are those with very low infection rates, such as New Zealand.

The EU could choose to exempt the UK and individual EU countries could create a ""travel corridor"" with the UK, allowing restriction-free travel.

When the pandemic ends, you'll be able to travel to all EU countries - plus Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein - as a tourist, without needing a visa.

How long can I go for?

You'll be able to stay for up to 90 days in any rolling 180-day period.

So, an Easter weekend in Spain, followed by a June fortnight in Italy, would be covered by your 90-day limit.

image copyright Getty Images

The rules for Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania are different. You could make a 90-day trip to any of them and still not use up your 90-day allowance for other EU countries.

You may need a visa or permit to stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel.

From 2022, UK nationals will have to pay for a visa-waiver scheme in order to visit many European countries.

Will I need a new passport?

No. Your current passport will be valid as long as:

It is less than 10 years old

And has six months left before it runs out

The six-month rule won't apply for visits to Ireland, because it is part of the Common Travel Area.

What about health insurance?

The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) entitles about 27 million UK citizens to state-provided medical treatment if they fall ill or have an accident in EU countries, as well as a number of others.

All EHIC cards issued before the end of 2020 will be valid until their expiry date. EHICs last for five years (the expiry date will be on the front of your card).

After that, the UK will issue a new card. The government says it will be called the UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC), but there are no further details yet on how to obtain it.

Like EHIC, the new card will cover chronic or existing illnesses and routine maternity care as well as emergencies.

The government's advice, however, says you should still buy travel insurance with healthcare cover before you go on holiday.

What queue can I use at passport control?

You'll no longer be able to use EU fast-track passport control and customs lanes.

When you arrive in an EU country (except Ireland) be prepared to show your return ticket. You could also be asked to show that you have enough money for your stay.

It could also take longer to cross the UK border.

Will I face mobile phone roaming charges?

The guarantee of free roaming throughout the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway ends on 1 January 2021.

You should check with your mobile provider to see if you're likely to face extra charges when you travel. The four main UK operators have said they have no plans to reintroduce roaming fees.

The EU and the UK agreed to cooperate on international mobile roaming, but there nothing in the new post-Brexit trade agreement that would stop travellers being charged for using their phone in the EU and vice versa, in the future.

The government has passed laws to protect customers, including:

A £45-a-month cap on using mobile data abroad (then you must opt-in to use more)

Requirements for customers to be informed when they've reached 80% and 100% of their data allowance.

Will I be able to drive in Europe?

Yes, but you'll need to take your driving licence, log book (V5C) and valid insurance documents.

You will need to contact your insurer six weeks before you travel to get a green card that will prove you have insurance that covers you in Europe.

Most drivers will not need to buy an International Driving Permit, with the exception of those with paper licences (not photocards) and those with licences issued in Gibraltar, Guernsey, Jersey or the Isle of Man, who will need one for some European countries.

Are pet passports still valid?

Pet passports issued in Great Britain will not be valid for travel to the EU from 1 January 2021. A new system will apply from that date.

From 1 January 2021, pets travelling from Great Britain to the EU will need to have an animal health certificate (AHC). The same rules will apply if you are taking your pet to Northern Ireland.

image copyright PA image caption In 2002, this dog was the first to travel to the UK using a pet passport

AHCs will be issued by a vet, will be valid for four months and must be obtained 10 days before travel.

AHCs will be valid for a single trip into the EU, onward travel within the EU and re-entry to Great Britain.

Your pet must have been microchipped and have had a rabies vaccination. It will also have to have a treatment against echinococcus multilicaris (a type of tapeworm) for entry into Finland, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Norway or Malta.

Can I buy duty free?

Passengers from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) travelling to EU countries can take advantage of duty-free shopping from January 2021.

Current duty-free limits on tobacco and alcohol, which apply only to non-EU countries at the moment, will also increase in the new year.",https://www.bbc.co.uk

Shops often place restrictions on returning sale items, so check the returns policy before buying. Most retailers impose time limits for returning non-faulty goods, such as 28 days.

So you can support a good cause and know your gift has gone to someone who actually wants it.

2. Regifting

Giving an unwanted present to someone else used to be taboo, but these days it’s a bit more acceptable as long as you’re thoughtful about who you hand it on to. ‘Regifting’, as it’s known, shouldn’t be about offloading undesirable tat onto others, but taking an item you already have or that doesn’t suit you and giving it to someone who’ll genuinely appreciate it.

The decision was announced on Tuesday night following the recommendations of the country's Covid-19 scientific committee.

The health ministry said the new strain of Covid-19 has not been recorded in Tunisia but added that the country was expected to roll out vaccines in April.

Official figures show that the death rate is averaging more than 40 a day and 77% of ICU beds across the country are now occupied.

764,"Some changes seem like they may be built to last. Paris added hundreds of kilometres of pop-up cycle lanes along the Rue du Rivoli, while in London a designated bike lane now runs along Hyde Park. Increased access to bike paths creates more incentives for ridership, which in turn reduces traffic and emissions. Meanwhile, bicycle retailers cannot meet the current demand for road bikes in the $500-$1,500 (£380-£1,140) range, leading consumers to look online for used bikes, fix up their old two-wheelers, or shell out cash for more expensive models.

While buy-in from consumers, urban designers and elected officials may make it seem like a robust trend, some business leaders remain sceptical, wondering if it makes sense to invest in boosted bicycle capacity long term given the economic anomalies of 2020. “It’s unlikely that this demand will keep up,” says Girardi.

Of course, expanding bicycle ridership depends on more than just an expansion of manufacturers or even access to specific bicycle parts. There’s another, overlooked aspect to the bike boom: the concurrent rise of e-cargo bikes, a phenomenon that has the potential to entirely remodel transportation. Known in the logistics industry as light electric freight vehicles (LEFVs), e-cargo bikes have electrical pedal assistance and can be ridden on roads and bicycle lanes, speeding goods and services to their destinations without getting caught in traffic or spewing emissions. In many cities, an LEFV can travel faster than a traditional delivery van because it can be ridden along bicycle bridges and other shortcuts.

For now, good old-fashioned cycling is enjoying a renaissance. Bicycles provide a socially distant way for essential workers and commuters to get around, a healthy alternative to gyms or subways, and a new vision of city streets. “Lockdown meant that suddenly the streets quietened, the air was clean and people felt safe,” says Butler-Adams. “Yes, there was fear of public transport, but mostly it was the joy of experiencing cities as they could be.”

774,"Driven by steeply falling prices and technological progress that allows batteries to store ever-larger amounts of energy, grid-scale systems are seeing record growth. Many of the gains are spillovers from the auto industry's race to build smaller, cheaper, and more powerful lithium-ion batteries for electric cars. In the US, state clean-energy mandates, along with tax incentives for storage systems that are paired with solar installations, are also playing an important role.

The mass deployment of storage could overcome one of the biggest obstacles to renewable energy – its cycling between oversupply when the sun shines or the wind blows, and shortage when the Sun sets or the wind drops. By smoothing imbalances between supply and demand, proponents say, batteries can replace fossil fuel ""peaker"" plants that kick in for a few hours a day when energy demands soar. As such, widespread energy storage could be key to expanding the reach of renewables and speeding the transition to a carbon-free power grid.

""Energy storage is actually the true bridge to a clean-energy future,"" says Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association.

You might also like:

How quickly that future arrives depends in large part on how rapidly costs continue to fall. Already the price tag for utility-scale battery storage in the US has plummeted, dropping nearly 70% between 2015 and 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. This sharp price drop has followed advances in lithium-ion battery chemistry to significantly improve performance. Battery capacity has expanded too, with facilities able to store and discharge energy over ever-longer periods of time. Market competition and rising battery production also play a major role; a projection by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory sees mid-range costs for lithium-ion batteries falling an additional 45% between 2018 and 2030.

""We're almost entirely piggybacking on the growth of lithium-ion battery technology, which is driven mostly by electric vehicles and consumer electronics,"" says Ray Hohenstein, market applications director for Fluence, an energy storage technology provider with projects totalling nearly 1 gigawatt (1,000 megawatts) set to come online in California within a year. The money put into research for those applications is driving down costs across the board, says Hohenstein. ""It's just like what we saw with solar panels.""

In California, falling battery prices, coupled with the state's aggressive push toward a carbon-free electrical grid by 2045, have led to a packed pipeline of storage projects. A 2013 bill set a target of 1.325 gigawatts of storage to be commissioned for the state's grid by 2020. With 1.5 gigawatts of projects now approved – including more than 500 megawatts installed so far – that goal has already been surpassed, according to the California Public Utilities Commission.",http://www.bbc.com

Although seaweed has been used in Indian folk medicine for thousands of years, it has never played as large a part in Indian culture as it has in other Asian countries. However, picking seaweed for traditional remedies is an age-old practice along coastal settlements such as Pamban Island and the Gulf of Mannar, a richly biodiverse area.

""My uncle Philip is one of the old generation,"" Ben says. ""He will be retiring soon. I don't think you can win over people. It's more about our generation making an impact.""

Given his knowledge and commitment to reducing climate change, how does Ben respond to critics who argue that we may have to stop eating meat and dairy entirely to make a significant dent in emissions? He pauses. ""I think it's a small minority, who are trying to ruin our future and a business that our family has tried to develop over 100 years. Come to my farm and have a look,"" he says. ""I can show you what we are doing to reduce our emissions footprint, and all the infrastructure we are investing so heavily in.""

When it's time to leave, I ask Hannah if hearing from Peter and Ben has changed her perspective. She harbours dreams of renting her own dairy farm with a small herd and setting up an ice cream business. If she is able to realise her ambitions, would she take steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?

""I suppose you would have to see the figures, but if we could catch the rainwater to wash the milking parlours and got wind turbines and solar panels to supply electricity, it wouldn't affect us farmers,"" she says. ""If there was a way to do our bit and our country did start making steps to improve our emissions, maybe other countries would follow."" But her doubts seem to catch up with her quickly. ""But maybe Philip is right? We don't know who is right and wrong – we don't know the facts.""

Where Hannah remains unsure about dairy farming's climate impact, there is another certainty that she will always come back to: her guiding principle.

""Cows are the most important thing. That's the way I look at it. As long as the cows are happy, we are happy.""

824,"Hawaiian shirts and gravy: Christmas tributes for loved ones lost to Covid Published duration 3 days ago

Christmas is different for everyone this year but especially for the thousands of UK families who have lost relatives to Covid-19.

Here, nine people reveal how they plan to remember the loved ones who are no longer here to celebrate the season with them.

My dad, the Welsh gravy king

Dean, Cardiff

""My father was an entrepreneur, raconteur and creative maverick - but he also had a huge heart,"" says neuroscientist and author Dean Burnett.

""He was also pathologically obsessed with gravy.""

Peter Burnett died in April at Morriston Hospital, Swansea. He was 58. In the 1980s and 90s, Dean's parents ran a pub in Pontycymer, in the Garw Valley north of Bridgend.

""My dad was a big community figure and his exploits are still talked about today,"" says Dean. ""It was a bit like growing up in Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights, but with different accents.""

image copyright Dean Burnett image caption Peter and Dean Burnett, and a pan of Dean's gravy

Last Christmas, Dean received a video message from his dad - which was just him delivering festive tidings while stirring a large vat of gravy.

""He always used to practise the gravy beforehand,"" says Dean. ""He'd make it in a big saucepan on the stove, tweaking his secret recipe a little each time.""

This year, Dean's in charge of the gravy. He too has practised in advance.

""I hope I can do my dad proud - and that my wife and children like it!""

I'll toast my action man and his Hawaiian shirts

Gail, Cheshire

""Harry thought of himself as a bit of a Bear Grylls. He was a passionate canoeist and loved being in charge of a good barbecue,"" says Gail, of her late husband.

Harry worked for Manchester University for nearly 40 years, before taking early retirement a year ago. He died in May aged 62.

""My sister in Sydney was always sending him Hawaiian shirts - and the week before he fell ill, he'd posed in a different one each day for Facebook.""

At Harry's funeral, each of Gail's sons wore one of Harry's shirts.

image copyright Gail Pickford image caption Harry (L) and Gail with her three sons

Gail joined a widows' support group, but says it was the couple's seven-year-old dachshund - Daisy - who helped her most through the past few months.

""She saved me through the grief. She's part of him now. She's always looking out, wondering where he is.""

image copyright Gail Pickford image caption Harry with Daisy the dachshund

Gail is spending Christmas with one of her sons - and Daisy of course. A new album filled with photos of Harry - and the Hawaiian shirts - will be open for the family to look through.

""We'll make sure we toast Harry and do our best to remember him.""

Mum's Christmas hamper lives on

Heather, County Down

""Mum came to us every Christmas and I'd make her a hamper of nice things. Her favourite jam, lovely smellies, things that she really liked,"" says Heather, who's a teacher in Belfast.

""A few weeks ago, it struck me that I wouldn't be able to make her a hamper this year.""

Andree died with Covid in hospital in June. She was 92. Heather wanted to carry on the hamper tradition.

image copyright Heather Houston image caption Andree with her daughter Heather

""I suppose because of my grief over Mum, it made me think of the number of elderly people alone,"" she says.

On Facebook, Heather asked friends and family to become a ""Silver Santa"" and provide a personalised present, for about £10, for care home residents.

But her initial post travelled far and wide. ""Within one week I had 800 offers!""

""Because of data protection, we only had the resident's initials, gender and what their favourite things were. One elderly man liked Manchester United and brandy.""

The gifts have been delivered to more than 40 care homes in North Down.

image copyright Heather Houston image caption Heather delivers some of the donated gifts

Andree was always on her sewing machine. When Heather cleared her house after her death, she found hundreds of handicrafts her mum had made over the years.

""I put some of Mum's crafts into a few of the gifts. A little bit of Mum is living on and doing good this Christmas.""

Gifts from my son, so we can remember him

Dorothy, Birmingham

""He was a wonderful son, brother and uncle. He'd buy me lunch and take me shopping. He was always there, always thinking of other people.""

Stephen died at the end of March. He was 39. His family weren't able to bury him until May.

""It was terrible, we were in bits. He was all alone and we couldn't see his body,"" says Dorothy. ""And then one night I had a dream. I was holding him and he told me, 'Mum don't worry, I'm all right.' I felt like I'd said goodbye.""

image copyright Dorothy Gayle image caption Stephen with Dorothy. and his personal items

At Christmas, the family will light 12 candles and say a prayer for Stephen. His brothers and sisters have already each taken one of his personal possessions - ""gifts from him for Christmas"", says Dorothy who has kept a few things for herself.

""A necklace with a lion's head which he had in the hospital - and one of his favourite T-shirts with Bob Marley on the front.""

My mum, the agony aunt

Rhys, Nottinghamshire

""My mum was the agony aunt of Kimberley,"" says Tina's son, Rhys.

Tina had worked for most of her adult life in two supermarkets in the small Nottinghamshire town. She knew everyone.

She died aged 53. Rhys and his brother Anthony were allowed to sit by her bedside, in PPE, until the very end. Their father, Tina's partner Mick, was recovering at home after his own battle with Covid-19.

image copyright Rhys Watkinson image caption Tina Cooke, funeral tributes and enjoying a family meal out

On the day of her funeral, hundreds of people stood outside their homes waving football flags and blowing whistles. Tina was a big supporter of the Rams - Derby County FC. Her football shirt would end up on her seat at Pride Park Stadium for some of the remaining games of the 2019-20 season.

Christmas will be tough says Rhys, but the family are working towards a fitting tribute. Tina will be remembered on an engraved memorial brick at the football ground, with her ashes interred inside.

I'll be on shift, just like my sister would have been

Kazeema, West Midlands

""We got married on the same day to two brothers. I looked after her kids and she looked after mine. She was my heart and soul,"" says Kazeema of her sister Areema.

A newly qualified nurse at the age of 36, Areema died where she worked - at Walsall Manor Hospital. ""She started at the hospital as a housekeeper in 2003,"" says Kazeema. ""Sixteen years later she fulfilled her dream of becoming a nurse.""

image copyright Kazeema Afzal image caption Areema Nasreen with her sisters and at graduation, and Kazeema Afzal (r)

Kazeema is a healthcare assistant in the department where Areema worked. Inspired by her sister, she's now trying to become a nurse herself.

""I want Areema to be proud of me. It's so difficult for some British Asian girls to get into higher education and study. They're expected to bring up families. This is so important.""

The hospital trust has set up a scholarship in Areema's name, which will fully fund a nursing degree for someone who cannot afford the fees. Kazeema says work has kept her sane since Areema died - and over Christmas she'll be on shift.

""Areema would have worked too if she was here,"" she says.

My mum, the angel who always spoke her mind

Joanne, East Lothian

""My mum was a bit of a shopaholic. She used to get taxis to the shops and banter with the drivers,"" says Joanne. ""When she died, I had nice messages from them saying they'd miss her blunt Glaswegian wit. She was funny, but I don't think she always realised it.""

Josie died in April. She was 77. Joanne lived near her mum in Dunbar, to the east of Edinburgh. She and her two daughters have bought a wreath and wicker robin to put on Josie's grave - and a new ornament for their Christmas tree.

image copyright Joanne Ross image caption Josie, Joanne and the angel ornaments and robin

""So we now have angel wings on the tree sitting together. One for Mum - and one for Dad, who died in 2008.""

With money her mum left her, Joanne has bought her daughters a final Christmas gift from their granny - some jewellery.

""Mum was a very bland eater. She always insisted on soup and roast beef for Christmas dinner. It's going to be strange not having her to focus on. We'll all miss her at the table.""

The tree near the sea

Denise, Cornwall

In the corner of a country garden, barely a mile from steep cliffs that overlook the sea, there's a newly planted crab apple tree.

It has already borne a couple of handfuls of bright red fruit and Denise is looking forward to spring - when it will come alive with scented, white blossom. She planted it in memory of her husband John. He always liked fruit trees.

John was 78 and had a long-term, painful medical condition. He was admitted to a hospital ward thought to be Covid-free - but soon developed symptoms. He died in the early hours of a Monday morning. ""That was the longest night of my life,"" says Denise.

The couple moved to their smallholding 20 years ago. For much of that time they reared a flock of sheep. Now though, there are just three animals to look after.

image copyright Denise image caption John and Denise in 2000, their sheep, and the crab apple tree she has planted in his memory

Denise has seen few people in the months since John's death, but she's hoping to see family at Christmas. She likes to sit on a bench close to John's tree.

""We'd like to scatter his ashes around the tree. I want the family to be there and they'd want to be there too. But if it can't be done at Christmas, I'm prepared to wait until spring - when the blossom arrives.""

We pray for my father daily at the cemetery - we'll do the same at Christmas

Ven, West Yorkshire

""Hard-working, that's how I would describe my father,"" says Ven. ""On the day of his burial, we passed through Pontefract Hospital. Some NHS staff and managers were waiting to pay their respects. It was very moving.""

Policarpio, who was originally from the Philippines, died in April aged 67. He was a nurse for more than 40 years before his recent retirement. For the last 18 years of his career he worked for Mid Yorkshire NHS Trust.

image copyright Ven dela Luna image caption Policarpio with his granddaughter and as a younger man

Since Policarpio's funeral in the spring, the family - who are Catholic - have visited the cemetery every day. Over Christmas, they'll do the same.

""It's very traditional. In the cemetery we take our rosary beads and recite a special prayer for the deceased - the 'Panalangin para sa mga Yumao'. It helps us think back to better times when my dad was with us. We miss him terribly.""",http://www.bbc.com

839,"Driven by steeply falling prices and technological progress that allows batteries to store ever-larger amounts of energy, grid-scale systems are seeing record growth. Many of the gains are spillovers from the auto industry's race to build smaller, cheaper, and more powerful lithium-ion batteries for electric cars. In the US, state clean-energy mandates, along with tax incentives for storage systems that are paired with solar installations, are also playing an important role.

The mass deployment of storage could overcome one of the biggest obstacles to renewable energy – its cycling between oversupply when the sun shines or the wind blows, and shortage when the Sun sets or the wind drops. By smoothing imbalances between supply and demand, proponents say, batteries can replace fossil fuel ""peaker"" plants that kick in for a few hours a day when energy demands soar. As such, widespread energy storage could be key to expanding the reach of renewables and speeding the transition to a carbon-free power grid.

""Energy storage is actually the true bridge to a clean-energy future,"" says Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association.

You might also like:

How quickly that future arrives depends in large part on how rapidly costs continue to fall. Already the price tag for utility-scale battery storage in the US has plummeted, dropping nearly 70% between 2015 and 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. This sharp price drop has followed advances in lithium-ion battery chemistry to significantly improve performance. Battery capacity has expanded too, with facilities able to store and discharge energy over ever-longer periods of time. Market competition and rising battery production also play a major role; a projection by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory sees mid-range costs for lithium-ion batteries falling an additional 45% between 2018 and 2030.

""We're almost entirely piggybacking on the growth of lithium-ion battery technology, which is driven mostly by electric vehicles and consumer electronics,"" says Ray Hohenstein, market applications director for Fluence, an energy storage technology provider with projects totalling nearly 1 gigawatt (1,000 megawatts) set to come online in California within a year. The money put into research for those applications is driving down costs across the board, says Hohenstein. ""It's just like what we saw with solar panels.""

In California, falling battery prices, coupled with the state's aggressive push toward a carbon-free electrical grid by 2045, have led to a packed pipeline of storage projects. A 2013 bill set a target of 1.325 gigawatts of storage to be commissioned for the state's grid by 2020. With 1.5 gigawatts of projects now approved – including more than 500 megawatts installed so far – that goal has already been surpassed, according to the California Public Utilities Commission.",https://www.bbc.com

But just below the sea’s surface, there is a change taking place which could transform the region's ecosystem, economy and even its cuisine – these coastal villages are the home of India's seaweed boom.

Although seaweed has been used in Indian folk medicine for thousands of years, it has never played as large a part in Indian culture as it has in other Asian countries. However, picking seaweed for traditional remedies is an age-old practice along coastal settlements such as Pamban Island and the Gulf of Mannar, a richly biodiverse area.

841,"Among this small group of Shropshire farmers, the views on dairy and climate cover much of the spectrum of debate. So how do they make sense of each others' differing views on climate?

""My uncle Philip is one of the old generation,"" Ben says. ""He will be retiring soon. I don't think you can win over people. It's more about our generation making an impact.""

Given his knowledge and commitment to reducing climate change, how does Ben respond to critics who argue that we may have to stop eating meat and dairy entirely to make a significant dent in emissions? He pauses. ""I think it's a small minority, who are trying to ruin our future and a business that our family has tried to develop over 100 years. Come to my farm and have a look,"" he says. ""I can show you what we are doing to reduce our emissions footprint, and all the infrastructure we are investing so heavily in.""

When it's time to leave, I ask Hannah if hearing from Peter and Ben has changed her perspective. She harbours dreams of renting her own dairy farm with a small herd and setting up an ice cream business. If she is able to realise her ambitions, would she take steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?

""I suppose you would have to see the figures, but if we could catch the rainwater to wash the milking parlours and got wind turbines and solar panels to supply electricity, it wouldn't affect us farmers,"" she says. ""If there was a way to do our bit and our country did start making steps to improve our emissions, maybe other countries would follow."" But her doubts seem to catch up with her quickly. ""But maybe Philip is right? We don't know who is right and wrong – we don't know the facts.""

Where Hannah remains unsure about dairy farming's climate impact, there is another certainty that she will always come back to: her guiding principle.

""Cows are the most important thing. That's the way I look at it. As long as the cows are happy, we are happy.""

862,"Hawaiian shirts and gravy: Christmas tributes for loved ones lost to Covid Published duration 3 days ago

Christmas is different for everyone this year but especially for the thousands of UK families who have lost relatives to Covid-19.

Here, nine people reveal how they plan to remember the loved ones who are no longer here to celebrate the season with them.

My dad, the Welsh gravy king

Dean, Cardiff

""My father was an entrepreneur, raconteur and creative maverick - but he also had a huge heart,"" says neuroscientist and author Dean Burnett.

""He was also pathologically obsessed with gravy.""

Peter Burnett died in April at Morriston Hospital, Swansea. He was 58. In the 1980s and 90s, Dean's parents ran a pub in Pontycymer, in the Garw Valley north of Bridgend.

""My dad was a big community figure and his exploits are still talked about today,"" says Dean. ""It was a bit like growing up in Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights, but with different accents.""

image copyright Dean Burnett image caption Peter and Dean Burnett, and a pan of Dean's gravy

Last Christmas, Dean received a video message from his dad - which was just him delivering festive tidings while stirring a large vat of gravy.

""He always used to practise the gravy beforehand,"" says Dean. ""He'd make it in a big saucepan on the stove, tweaking his secret recipe a little each time.""

This year, Dean's in charge of the gravy. He too has practised in advance.

""I hope I can do my dad proud - and that my wife and children like it!""

I'll toast my action man and his Hawaiian shirts

Gail, Cheshire

""Harry thought of himself as a bit of a Bear Grylls. He was a passionate canoeist and loved being in charge of a good barbecue,"" says Gail, of her late husband.

Harry worked for Manchester University for nearly 40 years, before taking early retirement a year ago. He died in May aged 62.

""My sister in Sydney was always sending him Hawaiian shirts - and the week before he fell ill, he'd posed in a different one each day for Facebook.""

At Harry's funeral, each of Gail's sons wore one of Harry's shirts.

Gail joined a widows' support group, but says it was the couple's seven-year-old dachshund - Daisy - who helped her most through the past few months.

""She saved me through the grief. She's part of him now. She's always looking out, wondering where he is.""

image copyright Gail Pickford image caption Harry with Daisy the dachshund

Gail is spending Christmas with one of her sons - and Daisy of course. A new album filled with photos of Harry - and the Hawaiian shirts - will be open for the family to look through.

""We'll make sure we toast Harry and do our best to remember him.""

Mum's Christmas hamper lives on

Heather, County Down

""Mum came to us every Christmas and I'd make her a hamper of nice things. Her favourite jam, lovely smellies, things that she really liked,"" says Heather, who's a teacher in Belfast.

""A few weeks ago, it struck me that I wouldn't be able to make her a hamper this year.""

Andree died with Covid in hospital in June. She was 92. Heather wanted to carry on the hamper tradition.

image copyright Heather Houston image caption Andree with her daughter Heather

""I suppose because of my grief over Mum, it made me think of the number of elderly people alone,"" she says.

On Facebook, Heather asked friends and family to become a ""Silver Santa"" and provide a personalised present, for about £10, for care home residents.

But her initial post travelled far and wide. ""Within one week I had 800 offers!""

""Because of data protection, we only had the resident's initials, gender and what their favourite things were. One elderly man liked Manchester United and brandy.""

The gifts have been delivered to more than 40 care homes in North Down.

image copyright Heather Houston image caption Heather delivers some of the donated gifts

Andree was always on her sewing machine. When Heather cleared her house after her death, she found hundreds of handicrafts her mum had made over the years.

""I put some of Mum's crafts into a few of the gifts. A little bit of Mum is living on and doing good this Christmas.""

Gifts from my son, so we can remember him

Dorothy, Birmingham

""He was a wonderful son, brother and uncle. He'd buy me lunch and take me shopping. He was always there, always thinking of other people.""

Stephen died at the end of March. He was 39. His family weren't able to bury him until May.

""It was terrible, we were in bits. He was all alone and we couldn't see his body,"" says Dorothy. ""And then one night I had a dream. I was holding him and he told me, 'Mum don't worry, I'm all right.' I felt like I'd said goodbye.""

image copyright Dorothy Gayle image caption Stephen with Dorothy. and his personal items

At Christmas, the family will light 12 candles and say a prayer for Stephen. His brothers and sisters have already each taken one of his personal possessions - ""gifts from him for Christmas"", says Dorothy who has kept a few things for herself.

""A necklace with a lion's head which he had in the hospital - and one of his favourite T-shirts with Bob Marley on the front.""

My mum, the agony aunt

Rhys, Nottinghamshire

""My mum was the agony aunt of Kimberley,"" says Tina's son, Rhys.

Tina had worked for most of her adult life in two supermarkets in the small Nottinghamshire town. She knew everyone.

She died aged 53. Rhys and his brother Anthony were allowed to sit by her bedside, in PPE, until the very end. Their father, Tina's partner Mick, was recovering at home after his own battle with Covid-19.

image copyright Rhys Watkinson image caption Tina Cooke, funeral tributes and enjoying a family meal out

On the day of her funeral, hundreds of people stood outside their homes waving football flags and blowing whistles. Tina was a big supporter of the Rams - Derby County FC. Her football shirt would end up on her seat at Pride Park Stadium for some of the remaining games of the 2019-20 season.

Christmas will be tough says Rhys, but the family are working towards a fitting tribute. Tina will be remembered on an engraved memorial brick at the football ground, with her ashes interred inside.

I'll be on shift, just like my sister would have been

Kazeema, West Midlands

""We got married on the same day to two brothers. I looked after her kids and she looked after mine. She was my heart and soul,"" says Kazeema of her sister Areema.

A newly qualified nurse at the age of 36, Areema died where she worked - at Walsall Manor Hospital. ""She started at the hospital as a housekeeper in 2003,"" says Kazeema. ""Sixteen years later she fulfilled her dream of becoming a nurse.""

image copyright Kazeema Afzal image caption Areema Nasreen with her sisters and at graduation, and Kazeema Afzal (r)

Kazeema is a healthcare assistant in the department where Areema worked. Inspired by her sister, she's now trying to become a nurse herself.

""I want Areema to be proud of me. It's so difficult for some British Asian girls to get into higher education and study. They're expected to bring up families. This is so important.""

The hospital trust has set up a scholarship in Areema's name, which will fully fund a nursing degree for someone who cannot afford the fees. Kazeema says work has kept her sane since Areema died - and over Christmas she'll be on shift.

""Areema would have worked too if she was here,"" she says.

My mum, the angel who always spoke her mind

Joanne, East Lothian

""My mum was a bit of a shopaholic. She used to get taxis to the shops and banter with the drivers,"" says Joanne. ""When she died, I had nice messages from them saying they'd miss her blunt Glaswegian wit. She was funny, but I don't think she always realised it.""

Josie died in April. She was 77. Joanne lived near her mum in Dunbar, to the east of Edinburgh. She and her two daughters have bought a wreath and wicker robin to put on Josie's grave - and a new ornament for their Christmas tree.

image copyright Joanne Ross image caption Josie, Joanne and the angel ornaments and robin

""So we now have angel wings on the tree sitting together. One for Mum - and one for Dad, who died in 2008.""

With money her mum left her, Joanne has bought her daughters a final Christmas gift from their granny - some jewellery.

""Mum was a very bland eater. She always insisted on soup and roast beef for Christmas dinner. It's going to be strange not having her to focus on. We'll all miss her at the table.""

The tree near the sea

Denise, Cornwall

In the corner of a country garden, barely a mile from steep cliffs that overlook the sea, there's a newly planted crab apple tree.

It has already borne a couple of handfuls of bright red fruit and Denise is looking forward to spring - when it will come alive with scented, white blossom. She planted it in memory of her husband John. He always liked fruit trees.

John was 78 and had a long-term, painful medical condition. He was admitted to a hospital ward thought to be Covid-free - but soon developed symptoms. He died in the early hours of a Monday morning. ""That was the longest night of my life,"" says Denise.

The couple moved to their smallholding 20 years ago. For much of that time they reared a flock of sheep. Now though, there are just three animals to look after.

image copyright Denise image caption John and Denise in 2000, their sheep, and the crab apple tree she has planted in his memory

Denise has seen few people in the months since John's death, but she's hoping to see family at Christmas. She likes to sit on a bench close to John's tree.

""We'd like to scatter his ashes around the tree. I want the family to be there and they'd want to be there too. But if it can't be done at Christmas, I'm prepared to wait until spring - when the blossom arrives.""

We pray for my father daily at the cemetery - we'll do the same at Christmas

Ven, West Yorkshire

""Hard-working, that's how I would describe my father,"" says Ven. ""On the day of his burial, we passed through Pontefract Hospital. Some NHS staff and managers were waiting to pay their respects. It was very moving.""

Policarpio, who was originally from the Philippines, died in April aged 67. He was a nurse for more than 40 years before his recent retirement. For the last 18 years of his career he worked for Mid Yorkshire NHS Trust.

image copyright Ven dela Luna image caption Policarpio with his granddaughter and as a younger man

Since Policarpio's funeral in the spring, the family - who are Catholic - have visited the cemetery every day. Over Christmas, they'll do the same.

For decades, the UK’s fishing fleet has been subject to the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).

The CFP allocates fishing rights among the EU’s 22 coastal states.

According to international law, a coastal nation’s fisheries should extend 200 nautical miles from its coastline or to a maritime halfway point, as part of an area known as the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

Outside the EU, the UK will become an independent coastal state, regaining control of its EEZ, but, as part of the trade deal, negotiators have been deciding how much fish EU boats should be allowed to catch in UK waters in future.

In 2018, EU-27 vessels caught 863,000 tonnes of fish - worth around £580m - in UK waters, while UK vessels landed 555,000 tonnes (including fish which were worth more), valued at £827m, in the same year.

Fishing only accounts for about 0.02% of the UK economy, but it was an important part of the Leave campaign in 2016, with many British fishermen keen for the UK to control its waters.

The decision was announced on Tuesday night following the recommendations of the country's Covid-19 scientific committee.

The health ministry said the new strain of Covid-19 has not been recorded in Tunisia but added that the country was expected to roll out vaccines in April.

Official figures show that the death rate is averaging more than 40 a day and 77% of ICU beds across the country are now occupied.

907,"New coronavirus variant: What do we know? By James Gallagher

Health and science correspondent Published duration 6 days ago

image copyright Getty Images

The rapid spread of a new variant of coronavirus has been blamed for the introduction of strict tier four mixing rules for millions of people, harsher restrictions on mixing at Christmas in England, Scotland and Wales, and other countries placing the UK on a travel ban.

So how has it gone from being non-existent to the most common form of the virus in parts of England in a matter of months?

The government's advisers on new infections now say they have ""high"" confidence that it is more able to transmit than other variants.

All the work is at an early stage, contains huge uncertainties and a long list of unanswered questions.

As I've written before, viruses mutate all the time and it's vital to keep a laser focus on whether the virus' behaviour is changing.

Why is this variant causing concern?

Three things are coming together that mean it is attracting attention:

It is rapidly replacing other versions of the virus

It has mutations that affect part of the virus likely to be important

Some of those mutations have already been shown in the lab to increase the ability of the virus to infect cells

All of these come together to build a case for a virus that can spread more easily.

However, we do not have absolute certainty. New strains can become more common simply by being in the right place at the right time - such as London, which had only tier two restrictions until recently.

But already the justification for tier four restrictions is in part to reduce the spread of the variant.

""Laboratory experiments are required, but do you want to wait weeks or months [to see the results and take action to limit the spread]? Probably not in these circumstances,"" Prof Nick Loman, from the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium, told me.

How much faster is it spreading?

It was first detected in September. In November around a quarter of cases in London were the new variant. This reached nearly two-thirds of cases in mid-December.

You can see how the variant has come to dominate the results of testing in some centres such as the Milton Keynes Lighthouse Laboratory.

View original tweet on Twitter

Mathematicians have been running the numbers on the spread of different variants in an attempt to calculate how much of an edge this one might have.

But teasing apart what is due to people's behaviour and what is due to the virus is hard.

The figure mentioned by Prime Minister Boris Johnson was that the variant may be up to 70% more transmissible. He said this may be increasing the R number - which indicates if an epidemic is growing or shrinking - by 0.4.

That 70% number appeared in a presentation by Dr Erik Volz, from Imperial College London, on Friday.

During the talk he said: ""It is really too early to tell… but from what we see so far it is growing very quickly, it is growing faster than [a previous variant] ever grew, but it is important to keep an eye on this.""

There is no ""nailed on"" figure for how much more infectious the variant may be. Scientists, whose work is not yet public, have told me figures both much higher and much lower than 70%.

But there remain questions about whether it is any more infectious at all.

""The amount of evidence in the public domain is woefully inadequate to draw strong or firm opinions on whether the virus has truly increased transmission,"" said Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham.

How far has it spread?

It is thought the variant either emerged in a patient in the UK or has been imported from a country with a lower ability to monitor coronavirus mutations.

The variant can be found across the UK, except Northern Ireland, but it is heavily concentrated in London, the South East and eastern England. Cases elsewhere in the country do not seem to have taken off.

Data from Nextstrain, which has been monitoring the genetic codes of the viral samples around the world, suggest cases in Denmark and Australia have come from the UK. The Netherlands has also reported cases.

For the UK variant:

Outside of the UK, we see very small numbers of sequences in Denmark (a bit hard to see - hidden behind UK circle) & Australia. Their position on the tree indicates that they're likely exports from the UK.

A similar variant that has emerged in South Africa shares some of the same mutations, but appears to be unrelated to this one.

Has this happened before?

Yes.

The virus that was first detected in Wuhan, China, is not the same one you will find in most corners of the world.

The D614G mutation emerged in Europe in February and became the globally dominant form of the virus.

Another, called A222V, spread across Europe and was linked to people's summer holidays in Spain.

What do we know about the new mutations?

An initial analysis of the new variant has been published and identifies 17 potentially important alterations.

There have been changes to the spike protein - this is the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway to our body's cells.

One mutation called N501Y alters the most important part of the spike, known as the ""receptor-binding domain"".

This is where the spike makes first contact with the surface of our body's cells. Any changes that make it easier for the virus to get inside are likely to give it an edge.

""It looks and smells like an important adaptation,"" said Prof Loman.

The other mutation - a H69/V70 deletion, in which a small part of the spike is removed - has emerged several times before, including famously in infected mink.

Work by Prof Ravi Gupta at the University of Cambridge has suggested this mutation increases infectivity two-fold in lab experiments.

Studies by the same group suggest the deletion makes antibodies from the blood of survivors less effective at attacking the virus.

Prof Gupta told me: ""It is rapidly increasing, that's what's worried government, we are worried, most scientists are worried.""

Where has it come from?

The variant is unusually highly mutated.

The most likely explanation is the variant has emerged in a patient with a weakened immune system that was unable to beat the virus.

Instead their body became a breeding ground for the virus to mutate.

Does it make the infection more deadly?

There is no evidence to suggest that it does, although this will need to be monitored.

However, just increasing transmission would be enough to cause problems for hospitals.

If the new variant means more people are infected more quickly, that would in turn lead to more people needing hospital treatment.

Will the vaccines work against the new variant?

Almost certainly yes, or at least for now.

All three leading vaccines develop an immune response against the existing spike, which is why the question comes up.

Vaccines train the immune system to attack several different parts of the virus, so even though part of the spike has mutated, the vaccines should still work.

""But if we let it add more mutations, then you start worrying,"" said Prof Gupta.

""This virus is potentially on a pathway for vaccine escape, it has taken the first couple of steps towards that.""

Vaccine escape happens when the virus changes so it dodges the full effect of the vaccine and continues to infect people.

This may be the most concerning element of what is happening with the virus.

But two spacecraft, built and launched in 1970s, have for the past few years been beaming back our first glimpses from this strange region we call interstellar space.

946,"As we head into 2021, Worklife is running our best, most insightful and most essential stories from 2020. Read our full list of the year’s top stories here.

Many of us are relieved to have ditched office commutes amid Covid-19, but what some see as a grind, others view as a ritual. For Nils Backhaus, who lives in Bochum, just outside Dortmund in Germany, even when he’s working from home commuting is still an essential part of his day that he can’t go without. At the end of the working day, around the time of 1700, the 34-year-old research and policy adviser for Germany’s Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health puts on his shoes, and gets on his racing bike to cruise through the tranquil landscapes along the Ruhr River.

This daily ride – what he calls his “fake commute” – mimics the trip he used to take returning from the office, before he transitioned to home working. It’s Backhaus’s way of recreating a more traditional start to ‘Feierabend’, a German word describing the time after work is done, and a period of leisure and rest begins.

“‘Feierabend’ has two meanings,” says Christoph Stengel, a 41-year-old Berliner who works as a software developer at price-comparison website Idealo. “First, it's the moment you stop working for the rest of the day – of course, [it’s] a good feeling then. Second, it's the part of the day between work and going to bed.”

It might seem surprising that Germans, who are often stereotyped as hard, efficient workers, cherish their leisure time so protectively. But the concept of Feierabend is also linked to a very capitalist mentality that companies get more productivity – and therefore more value – out of their labour force if workers are allowed clear periods of rest after work.

“You have to rest after work directly, you can’t do double time the next day,” says Backhaus. “The stress and recovery go hand in hand. It’s like a bodily rhythm.”",https://www.bbc.com
947,"(This year, we published many inspiring and amazing stories that made us fall in love with the world – and this is one our favourites. Click here for the full list).

Many a conversation in France begins with a sigh and a lament: the weather is bad; the grape harvest is worse; politicians are inept and stupid to boot. When I first moved to France more than a decade ago as a starry-eyed 19-year-old American, I was disquieted by this constant barrage of complaints. Why, I wondered, were the French always in such a bad mood? But when I finally got up the courage to ask a French friend, he baulked: they weren’t complainers, he said. They were râleurs.

In France, there are several words for “to complain”: there’s “se plaindre”, used for regular old complaining; there’s “porter plainte”, for complaining more officially. And then there’s “râler”: complaining just for the fun of it.

“Râleris informal, even curmudgeonly (think “grumble” or “grouch”),” explained Dr Gemma King, senior lecturer in French at the Australian National University and editor of the blog Les Musées de Paris. “You might râler about doing something but still do it (albeit begrudgingly), whereas porter plainte implies you will not be doing something and someone will be hearing about why.”

When I was still in the throes of applying for French residency permits, and French citizenship was still a lofty dream, I used to joke that I would know I was truly French before receiving the confirmation letter because I would certainly waken with the uncontrollable urge to moan and groan. In preparation for that fateful day, I would mock-whine to anyone who would listen:the soup is too cold; the salad is too warm; a neighbour neglected to say “bonjour” to me.

You may also be interested in:

But while my friends laughed at my attempts to sigh like a French person, it was a bit, I imagine, like watching a child who has yet to fully grasp language pretend to talk on the phone. The appropriateness of when, to whom and about what to râle is a delicate art, and one that I had yet to fully master.

In France, a complaint is an appropriate – and frequent – conversation starter. One could begin talking about a restaurant by focusing on the poor service during an otherwise great meal, or highlight the fact that the east-facing windows in your new flat mean you now have to buy curtains. But while, as Julie Barlow, Canadian journalist and co-author of The Bonjour Effect, explained, “To Americans, saying something negative sounds like you’re closing the conversation”, in France, such comments are perceived as “a way to invite other people’s opinions”. North Americans, she said, are not as comfortable with confrontation – or with criticism – as the French are. Râler, then, “comes across as something that’s more intelligent than being too starry-eyed and optimistic about things”.

Anna Polonyi, a Franco-Hungarian-American writer and head of the creative writing department at the Paris Institute for Critical Thinking, posited that this distinction may stem from a core fear shared by many Americans: that of being perceived as “a loser”.

“There’s no word for that, in France,” she said. “In order to be a loser, the world around you needs to think of things in terms of winning. And I’m not sure that that’s necessarily how people see social interactions [here].”

In France, conversations could instead be likened to “duels,” according to Barlow, and the opening punch may well be a complaint – a display of demonstrable intellect, “something that makes people seem critical and like they’re thinking and not naïve”.

Polonyi experienced this first-hand when she moved from France, where she was raised, to Iowa. There, she noticed, people kept themselves from negative speech as long as they could, only unleashing a barrage of complaints when it had built up far beyond what they could stand.

“It wasn’t complaining the way that we knew it; it was venting,” she said. “It felt like people weren’t giving themselves permission to complain in a way that actually built intimacy. They were just sort of not doing it until it was impossible not to.”

Polonyi even found herself picking up on an American tic: concluding her complaining with an addendum. “When I complain in English, it gets slotted into this narrative,” she said. “I have a certain expectation that at the end of that conversation I need to be like, ‘Oh, but I’m gonna get through it!’.”

I think the French are optimistic and positive about themselves and their lives, but they tend to be really hard on their country

In French, on the contrary, there is no need for a conclusion. “I feel like the more specifically I can complain, the more I can move the other person to feel sort of empathetic about how horrible something is,” she said.

The French attitude towards complaining is uncomfortable for many Anglophones, many of whom argue that negativity breeds negativity. But according to some experts, the French attitude may in fact be better for your health. A 2013 study in Biological Psychiatry found that attempts to regulate negative emotions could be linked with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, while 2011 study from the University of Texas at Austin found that bottling up negative emotions can make people more aggressive.

This isn’t to say that complaining is always positive. Complaining too often can get you caught in a spiral, actually rewiring your brain to always focus on the negative. But French râleurs may well avoid this unfortunate side effect, in part because they rarely complain about their own lives but rather about external issues.

According to a poll on the practice, 48% of French people surveyed said that the thing that they complained about most was the government. It’s perhaps no surprise then, according to a recent article in Politico, that the French opinion of President Emmanuel Macron’s handling of the pandemic was overwhelmingly negative. Personal issues, meanwhile, are very low on the list of things the French choose to râle about, according to the poll, with 23% complaining when people don’t call them back, 33% complaining when they can’t find their keys or phone and only 12% complaining about issues linked to their children.

“I think the French are optimistic and positive about themselves and their lives, but they tend to be really hard on their country,” said Barlow. “Don’t go to a party and praise France; people will laugh at you.”

According to Margot Bastin, a researcher at Belgian university Katholieke Universiteit Leuven who has published peer-reviewed papers on the effects of internalising negative emotions, the fact that the French focus on issues that are “not personal, not related to themselves” may indeed be healthier. But Bastin’s research has also found that while a certain amount of venting can be helpful, it is “detrimental [when it] becomes a very prolonged process, when it happens excessively”.

If someone’s complaining, I feel like there’s authenticity there

But the French on the whole, do not tend to catastrophise – nor, as Polonyi noticed, rarely does their complaining even have a goal of resolution. While there’s no dearth of Americans wanting to speak to a manager to right a wrong or Brits audibly sighing when someone is queuing improperly, in France, complaining is not seen as a means to an end.

“I don’t think that they’re complaining because they necessarily want to change anything,” said Barlow. “I think it’s a cultural, conversational tic.”

As with most conversational tics – like asking how someone is without actually caring to know the answer – complaining in France is above all a means of forging interpersonal connection. And it’s an apt one. One study conducted at the University of Oklahoma showed that complaining may have a positive impact on connectivity; and research also shows that it can be a useful tool for bonding.

“The other person is listening to you, you really feel connected with the other person, you really feel close to the other person, you feel understood,” said Bastin.

To wit, I never felt more French as when I left a scenario that only served to highlight my foreignness: going to the police prefecture to renew my residency card. After a truly Kafka-esque journey through the bowels of the bureaucratic office, I complained to anyone who would listen, painting a portrait of the ineptitude of those in charge, of obsoleteness of the list of documents I had been asked to prepare.

And while my French friends did not share this specific experience, they used it as a jumping-off point for complaints of their own: experiences with the tax office or zoning department, where other bureaucrats threw other wrenches in other wheels. It was, apparently, a common complaint.

After years of living in France, I was finally building intimacy with locals; I just hadn’t known I would have to complain so much to get there.

“If someone’s complaining, I feel like there’s authenticity there,” Polonyi said, “and I’m reassured by that authenticity. Because I feel like, in a way, complaining is, in some sense, being vulnerable.”

948,"""We were all trying to collect ourselves and we didn't know what actually was in the room, what we were really dealing with [or] what [were] the underpinnings of that scene,"" Domingo recalled during a Netflix Q&A event for the film last month. ""That emotion was a whisper at first, then it was a roar. That man had this fight in him to the very end.""

On 28 August 2020, Chadwick Boseman passed away having been diagnosed with colon cancer four years earlier, and the world gasped with grief; he had never revealed his diagnosis publicly, or even to his work colleagues. Boseman was a symbol of black excellence and of cinematic excellence, and at just 43 years old he was robbed of a future in which he was primed for even more professional success and personal fulfilment. He was a virtuoso and heroic figure, not just because of his iconic turn as Marvel's Black Panther but for how he raised the bar for racial equality and representation on screen. He was committed to this creative and cultural endeavour throughout his career and it's what makes his cinematic legacy awe-inspiring.

A hero from the beginning

From his earliest roles on screen, the South Carolina native wanted to combat the pejorative stereotyping of black people in popular culture. Aged 26, Boseman was fired by the producers of soap opera All My Children for raising concerns about his character Reggie being written as little more than a teen thug. As he told The Wrap in 2019, it was not part of his ""manifesto"" to play these types of damaging stereotypes – especially as a graduate of Howard University, a historically black institution that had ""instilled in [him] a certain amount of pride,"" as he made clear during a speech at its commencement ceremony in 2018. The role ""didn't live up to those standards"" so he shared his opinion with the producers and they recast him with a then-16-year-old Michael B Jordan. ""They said, 'You are too much trouble, ' but they took my suggestions, or some of them,"" Boseman told The Wrap. ""And for me, honestly, that’s what this is about.""",https://www.bbc.com

950,"The eyes of future historians are on us now. The year 2020 has been tumultuous, disruptive, exhausting, and pivotal – and one day, our great-grandchildren may wonder what it was like to live through these times. Yet with all that has happened over the past 12 months, only snapshots may be recorded in the long-term: the most salient traumas and the most dramatic turning points. History often charts the stories of the privileged, the powerful or the notorious, but cannot capture all of human experience.

So, what might we wish future generations to know about this year? If you could leave behind an object that spoke of 2020, what would it be?

As the year comes to an end, BBC Future decided to assemble a virtual time capsule – a list of objects that matter, and that tomorrow's generations should know about, 100 years from now.

Collaborating with the School of International Futures, we asked their network and global next-generation fellows to nominate a series of objects. To that list, we added a few extra submissions from other future thinkers – plus one or two of our own.

Some might wish to forget this year. However, the objects we collated are intended to be symbols of acts, experiences, ideas and changes that are worth preserving. We asked our submitters to propose items they believe deserve attention and memorialisation during these turbulent times. As well as the trauma, this year has also brought some positive changes that we don't want to lose, moments when things got a little bit better amid the chaos, local wisdom or inspiration, as well as warnings that we might hope will not be forgotten.

For nearly 10 years, I have spent my Monday evenings attending rehearsals for my amateur choir. Mondays are not my favourite day, and I often arrive in a bad mood, but by the end of the rehearsal, I usually feel energised. The singing does me good. So do the people. With a few exceptions, I wouldn’t describe my fellow choir members as close friends; most of them, I barely know at all. We exchange brief chats, smiles and the odd joke – but that’s enough for me to come away feeling a little better about the world.

There is no choir practice now, and won’t be for a long time. I miss it. In lockdown, I don’t feel short on affection or emotional support, but I do feel short of friendly faces and casual conversations. Another way of putting this is that I miss my weak ties.

In 1973, Mark Granovetter, a sociology professor at Stanford University, published a paper entitled The Strength of Weak Ties. It went on to become one of the most influential sociology papers of all time. Until then scholars had assumed that an individual’s well-being depended mainly on the quality of relationships with close friends and family. Granovetter showed that quantity matters, too.

One way to think about any person’s social world is that you have an inner circle of people whom you often talk to and feel close with, and an outer circle of acquaintances whom you see infrequently or fleetingly. Granovetter named these categories “strong ties” and “weak ties”. His central insight was that for new information and ideas, weak ties are more important to us than strong ones.

Granovetter surveyed 282 Boston-based workers and found that most of them got their jobs through someone they knew. But only a minority got the job through a close friend; 84% got their job through those weak-tie relationships – meaning casual contacts whom they saw only occasionally. As Granovetter pointed out, the people whom you spend a lot of time with swim in the same pool of information as you do. We depend on friendly outsiders to bring us news of opportunities from beyond our immediate circles – and so the more of those acquaintances we have, the better.",https://www.bbc.com/schoolreport

967,"Covid: How does mass testing work? By Ian Westbrook

BBC News Published duration 3 days ago

image copyright Getty Images

Mass testing is coming to be seen as a key part of stopping the spread of Covid.

The hope is that it can identify people who may be contagious - including those without symptoms.

It's being deployed to help the lorry drivers stranded in Kent and is going to be expanded in care homes.

What is mass testing and why is it important?

Mass testing makes it easier to find people who may be unaware that they are infected.

They can then be told to isolate and be prevented from spreading the virus.

Mass testing can also be used in more targeted ways, including:

Regular testing in a hospital or care home to prevent outbreaks

To keep open places such as schools and universities where the virus can spread

Helping people safely attend a cinema, theatre or football match with a one-off test before entry

What tests are being offered?

Pilot schemes have offered two types of testing, both involve swabbing the nose or throat.

The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test is regarded as the ""gold standard"" by epidemiologists, but takes up to a day or longer to produce a result because the sample is sent off to a laboratory.

The lateral flow test involves a handheld kit that gives a result - a bit like a pregnancy test - in about 20 minutes. There's no need for a lab. Fluid from a nasal swab or saliva goes on one end, then a marking appears if you are positive.

What happens if I test positive?

Anyone who tests positive must immediately self-isolate for at least 10 days. Their contacts will be traced by NHS Test and Trace, and must isolate if told to do so.

Self-isolating means staying at home and not leaving even to buy food, medicines or other essentials, or for exercise.

People should order online groceries, or ask friends and family to get supplies and leave them outside the front door.

Anyone in England who fails to self-isolate after a positive test can be fined up to £10,000.

Anyone on low income who has been told to self-isolate in a phone call from NHS Test and Trace, can claim a £500 payment from their local authority.

image copyright Getty Images image caption Mass testing is being carried out to ease the backlog of drivers stuck on their journey to France

How is it helping stranded lorry drivers?

Mass testing is being used to help clear long queues of lorries in Kent, after France shut its border to prevent the new coronavirus variant spreading.

Soldiers are working with NHS Test and Trace staff to give the lorry drivers lateral flow tests. They need proof of a negative test less than 72 hours before leaving for France, and will receive the result by text.

Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said it is likely to take ""a few days"" to clear the backlog.

Testing will happen at ""multiple"" sites at Manston Airport, where more than 3,000 lorries are being held, and elsewhere.

Any who test positive will be offered Covid-secure hotel accommodation and must self-isolate.

What's happening in schools?

Mass Covid testing of secondary school pupils in England is to be stepped up in January.

Staff will be offered a weekly test, and daily tests if they have had a case in their class.

Any pupil who has come into contact with a positive case will be offered daily tests for seven days. Previously, a whole bubble, class or year group might have been sent home.

Tests will be optional and require parental consent. Testing in primary schools could begin later in the term.

Children under 16 need to be accompanied by a parent or guardian to use a mobile testing unit.

Where else will mass testing be available?

Currently, most people can only have a test if they already have symptoms.

But under England's new, stricter tier system, the government want mass testing happening in areas with high infection rates.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said another £149m in funds will be invested into rapid testing in care homes.

Staff ""will receive two rapid tests a week in addition to their weekly PCR test"", he said.

This follows the success of Liverpool's scheme, where everyone living or working in the city was offered a voluntary test.

Cases there fell from 635 per 100,000 people in mid-October to 99 by mid-December.

How is mass testing in towns and cities carried out?

In addition to testing the general population, local authorities could also target high-risk workplaces and hard-to-reach communities.

This could be similar to the Liverpool pilot, which used mobile testing sites in care homes and schools.

Social distancing remains a key part of the UK's strategy for keeping people safe and preventing the spread of Covid-19.

It means keeping a certain distance away from other people to lessen the risk of passing on - or catching - coronavirus.

What are the rules in each UK nation?

Each nation has slightly different advice:

In Scotland people should keep 2m away from each other. Shops are reintroducing measures to support 2m physical distancing, like one-way systems. There are exemptions in some places like pubs, and children aged 11 or under do not need to social distance

There are exemptions in some places like pubs, and children aged 11 or under do not need to social distance In England , if you can't stay 2m away, you can stay ""1m plus"" apart (the ""plus"" means doing something else to limit possible exposure, like wearing a face covering)

, if you can't stay 2m away, you can stay ""1m plus"" apart (the ""plus"" means doing something else to limit possible exposure, like wearing a face covering) In Wales , the guidance is to stay 2m apart unless it is not practical (for instance, at a hairdresser's); primary-age children in Wales are also exempt

, the guidance is to stay 2m apart unless it is not practical (for instance, at a hairdresser's); primary-age children in Wales are also exempt Northern Ireland's guidance was 1m (3ft) for a time, but is now back at 2m

Social distancing is important because coronavirus spreads mainly when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks, and transmits small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air.

These droplets can land in other people's mouths or noses nearby or may be inhaled into the lungs. You could also be infected after touching a surface on which the droplets have landed.

The risks are far higher indoors than outdoors.

How can I meet other people safely and can we hug?

Social distancing is a key element of meeting others safely.

The only people you do not need to socially distance from are:

People in your household

Anyone in your support bubble, if you have one

Otherwise, when seeing anybody else you must:

Follow social distancing rules

Avoid physical contact like a handshake or hug

Not be too close or face-to-face

Not shout or sing too close to them

How many people can I meet?

Different restrictions apply across the UK.

England is currently under a national lockdown, during which nobody can meet anyone from outside their household or support bubble indoors. Children under five don't count.

They can meet one other person in an outdoor public place, such as a park.

Scotland is moving to a five-tier system of restrictions from Monday, with rules about meeting people different at each level.

The lockdown in Wales has now finished. Two households in Wales can now form a bubble and can meet in their own homes, while up to 15 people are allowed to meet for organised activities indoors, and up to 30 outdoors.

People living in Northern Ireland are also currently under restrictions. Support bubbles are limited to a maximum of 10 people from two households.

Are there any exceptions?

Exceptions to social distancing rules in England include:

A household or support bubble larger than six

Education and training

Workplaces

Jury duty or other legal commitments

Health editor, BBC News online Published duration 12 November

image copyright Getty Images

Record numbers of Covid-19 cases are being confirmed across the UK. But given it's also the flu season, how can you be sure whether you have coronavirus, a cold or the flu?

They are all caused by different viruses, but can have similar symptoms.

Most people who feel ill with coronavirus will have at least one of these three key symptoms:

a high temperature

a new, continuous cough

a loss or change to their sense of smell or taste

So what do you need to know about other things you may catch in the coming months?

Does a fever mean I have coronavirus?

media caption A cold, flu or coronavirus - which one do I have?

A high temperature is 37.8C or above. A fever like this can happen when the body is fighting off any infection - not just coronavirus.

It is best to use a thermometer to take a measure. But if you don't have one, check if you, or the person you are worried about, feels hot to the touch on the chest or back.

Although fever is a key coronavirus symptom, it could be flu or a different infection.

A high temperature is unlikely with a cold.

If you have a fever, arrange a coronavirus test - you can use the NHS 111 coronavirus service online.

What about a cough?

If you have a cold or flu you may well have a cough, along with other symptoms.

Flu usually comes on suddenly and sufferers will often experience muscle aches, chills, headaches, tiredness, a sore throat and a runny or stuffed nose, along with the cough. It feels worse than a heavy cold.

Colds tend to develop more gradually and are less severe, although they do still make you feel unwell. Along with a cough, there may be sneezing and a sore throat and runny nose. Fever, chills, muscle aches and headaches are rare.

A coronavirus cough means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing fits or ""episodes"" in 24 hours.

If you usually have a cough because of a long-standing medical condition like COPD, it may be worse than usual.

You should get tested for coronavirus if you develop a new, continuous cough.

What do loss or change to smell or taste mean?

These are key symptoms of coronavirus and mean you should get a test.

It could still be that you have a simple cold. But you need to check, even if you don't feel unwell, to avoid the risk of spreading the virus.

Does sneezing mean I've got coronavirus?

Sneezing is not a symptom of coronavirus, and unless you also have a fever, cough or loss of smell and taste, you do not need a test.

Sneeze droplets can spread infections though, so catch them in a tissue, put it in the bin and then wash your hands.

Remember Hands. Face. Space to help stop the spread of coronavirus and other illnesses:

Wash your hands regularly

Use a face covering when social distancing is not possible

Try to keep your distance from those not in your household

More people in England are being offered a free flu jab this year too in the run-up to winter.

How about a runny or blocked nose?

As we head into winter and with children back to school and more workplaces open, lots of people will be getting colds.

A runny nose is not a reason to get tested for coronavirus, says NHS Scotland.

Data from an app that has been monitoring Covid-19 symptoms, reported by UK users, suggests children present less often with respiratory symptoms and are more likely to be suffering from fever, headaches, fatigue and skin rashes.

What if I am very unwell?

People with coronavirus have a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild to severe, although some will have none at all, but can still be infectious.

Symptoms may appear up to two weeks after exposure to coronavirus, but usually around day five.

Feeling breathless can be a sign of a more serious coronavirus infection.

If you are having trouble breathing, contact your doctor online or over the phone, or the NHS 111 online coronavirus service.

If you are very worried about sudden shortness of breath ring 999.

978,"Coronavirus: What are the rules for face masks or face coverings? By Michelle Roberts

Health editor, BBC News online Published duration 30 October

media caption How to wear your mask. Hint: it's not any of these three options

People around the UK must now wear face coverings in many public places.

But what protection do they offer, and what sort of coverings can be worn?

Why should we wear a face covering?

Face coverings reduce the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and speaking.

They should mainly be worn to protect other people from coronavirus, rather than yourself.

When worn correctly, they should cover the nose and mouth, which are the main confirmed sources of transmission.

They can help to reduce the spread of the virus from people who are contagious, including those who have no symptoms, or are yet to develop them.

There is also evidence they can offer some protection to the wearer, although they are not a replacement for social distancing and hand-washing.

Where must they be worn in the UK?

Face coverings are now compulsory across the UK when:

Travelling on public transport

In shops, supermarkets and shopping centres

Not seated at a table to eat or drink in hospitality venues

People can be refused travel for not following the rules or fined as a last resort. In England, the police can issue a £200 fine to someone breaking the face covering rules. In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, a £60 fine can be imposed. Repeat offenders face bigger fines.

In England and Scotland, face coverings are also compulsory in a number of indoor spaces, including:

Banks, building societies and post offices

Places of worship

Museums, galleries and entertainment venues

Libraries and public reading rooms

Scotland also requires face coverings to be worn in indoor spaces, such as staff canteens and corridors in workplaces. It no longer requires couples to wear them when exchanging marriage vows.

In Wales, face coverings must be worn in all indoor public places by customers and staff.

In Northern Ireland, they must be worn in ""any other indoor place where goods or services are available to buy or rent"".

Does everyone have to wear one?

Some people do not have to wear a face covering. They include:

Children (under 11 in England or Wales, under 13 in Northern Ireland, under five in Scotland)

Those unable to put on or wear a face covering because of a physical or mental illness or disability

People for whom wearing or removing a face covering will cause severe distress

Anyone assisting someone who relies on lip reading to communicate

You can remove your mask if:

You need to eat, drink, or take medication

A police officer or other official asks you to, or for shop staff to verify your age

You are entering a shop to avoid harm, if you do not have a mask on you

Young children should not wear face masks because of the risk of choking and suffocation.

What are the face-covering rules in schools?

The government does not recommend wearing face coverings in schools and colleges because of the controls already in place.

However, each nation is adopting different rules:

In England, secondary schools will have the ''discretion'' to require face coverings in communal areas, where social distancing is not possible

The Scottish government says all secondary school pupils should wear face coverings in corridors and communal areas, and senior pupils (years S4-S6) and their teachers must wear them in class

In addition, all staff in Scottish schools must wear masks where social distancing is not possible

In Wales, face coverings are recommended in high schools when social distancing is ""unlikely to be maintained"", but are not compulsory

In Northern Ireland, face coverings must be worn in the corridors of post-primary schools

However, they will be mandatory for schools in parts of England that are under local restrictions, but not in classrooms.

Can I make one myself?

The BBC has created a guide on how to make your own face covering.

The government has issued its own advice too.

Do face coverings work?

Face coverings do not give the wearer as much protection as the masks that healthcare workers wear.

World Health Organization (WHO) advice says non-medical face coverings should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible.

984,"One of the most closely-scrutinised parts of the trade deal will be what it says about fishing, despite it being a very small part of the UK and EU economies.

For decades, the UK’s fishing fleet has been subject to the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).

The CFP allocates fishing rights among the EU’s 22 coastal states.

According to international law, a coastal nation’s fisheries should extend 200 nautical miles from its coastline or to a maritime halfway point, as part of an area known as the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

Outside the EU, the UK will become an independent coastal state, regaining control of its EEZ, but, as part of the trade deal, negotiators have been deciding how much fish EU boats should be allowed to catch in UK waters in future.

In 2018, EU-27 vessels caught 863,000 tonnes of fish - worth around £580m - in UK waters, while UK vessels landed 555,000 tonnes (including fish which were worth more), valued at £827m, in the same year.

Fishing only accounts for about 0.02% of the UK economy, but it was an important part of the Leave campaign in 2016, with many British fishermen keen for the UK to control its waters.

image copyright Getty Images

Rules on travelling to and from European Union countries will change on 1 January 2021.

That's because an agreement between the UK and EU to keep many things the same - for 11 months after Brexit - comes to an end by then.

A post-Brexit deal between the UK and the EU has now been reached, with lots of new rules on trade and in other areas.

Can I go on holiday to the EU after 1 January?

At the moment, no.

Because of Covid, travellers from most non-EU countries can't visit except for essential reasons.

After 31 December, the UK will no longer be treated like a member of the EU, so becomes subject to these rules.

The only non-EU countries exempt from these restrictions are those with very low infection rates, such as New Zealand.

The EU could choose to exempt the UK and individual EU countries could create a ""travel corridor"" with the UK, allowing restriction-free travel.

When the pandemic ends, you'll be able to travel to all EU countries - plus Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein - as a tourist, without needing a visa.

How long can I go for?

You'll be able to stay for up to 90 days in any rolling 180-day period.

So, an Easter weekend in Spain, followed by a June fortnight in Italy, would be covered by your 90-day limit.

image copyright Getty Images

The rules for Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania are different. You could make a 90-day trip to any of them and still not use up your 90-day allowance for other EU countries.

You may need a visa or permit to stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel.

From 2022, UK nationals will have to pay for a visa-waiver scheme in order to visit many European countries.

Will I need a new passport?

No. Your current passport will be valid as long as:

It is less than 10 years old

And has six months left before it runs out

The six-month rule won't apply for visits to Ireland, because it is part of the Common Travel Area.

What about health insurance?

The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) entitles about 27 million UK citizens to state-provided medical treatment if they fall ill or have an accident in EU countries, as well as a number of others.

All EHIC cards issued before the end of 2020 will be valid until their expiry date. EHICs last for five years (the expiry date will be on the front of your card).

After that, the UK will issue a new card. The government says it will be called the UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC), but there are no further details yet on how to obtain it.

Like EHIC, the new card will cover chronic or existing illnesses and routine maternity care as well as emergencies.

The government's advice, however, says you should still buy travel insurance with healthcare cover before you go on holiday.

What queue can I use at passport control?

You'll no longer be able to use EU fast-track passport control and customs lanes.

When you arrive in an EU country (except Ireland) be prepared to show your return ticket. You could also be asked to show that you have enough money for your stay.

It could also take longer to cross the UK border.

Will I face mobile phone roaming charges?

The guarantee of free roaming throughout the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway ends on 1 January 2021.

You should check with your mobile provider to see if you're likely to face extra charges when you travel. The four main UK operators have said they have no plans to reintroduce roaming fees.

The EU and the UK agreed to cooperate on international mobile roaming, but there nothing in the new post-Brexit trade agreement that would stop travellers being charged for using their phone in the EU and vice versa, in the future.

The government has passed laws to protect customers, including:

A £45-a-month cap on using mobile data abroad (then you must opt-in to use more)

Requirements for customers to be informed when they've reached 80% and 100% of their data allowance.

Will I be able to drive in Europe?

Yes, but you'll need to take your driving licence, log book (V5C) and valid insurance documents.

You will need to contact your insurer six weeks before you travel to get a green card that will prove you have insurance that covers you in Europe.

Most drivers will not need to buy an International Driving Permit, with the exception of those with paper licences (not photocards) and those with licences issued in Gibraltar, Guernsey, Jersey or the Isle of Man, who will need one for some European countries.

Are pet passports still valid?

Pet passports issued in Great Britain will not be valid for travel to the EU from 1 January 2021. A new system will apply from that date.

From 1 January 2021, pets travelling from Great Britain to the EU will need to have an animal health certificate (AHC). The same rules will apply if you are taking your pet to Northern Ireland.

image copyright PA image caption In 2002, this dog was the first to travel to the UK using a pet passport

AHCs will be issued by a vet, will be valid for four months and must be obtained 10 days before travel.

AHCs will be valid for a single trip into the EU, onward travel within the EU and re-entry to Great Britain.

Your pet must have been microchipped and have had a rabies vaccination. It will also have to have a treatment against echinococcus multilicaris (a type of tapeworm) for entry into Finland, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Norway or Malta.

Can I buy duty free?

Passengers from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) travelling to EU countries can take advantage of duty-free shopping from January 2021.

Official figures show that the death rate is averaging more than 40 a day and 77% of ICU beds across the country are now occupied.

1099,"Some changes seem like they may be built to last. Paris added hundreds of kilometres of pop-up cycle lanes along the Rue du Rivoli, while in London a designated bike lane now runs along Hyde Park. Increased access to bike paths creates more incentives for ridership, which in turn reduces traffic and emissions. Meanwhile, bicycle retailers cannot meet the current demand for road bikes in the $500-$1,500 (£380-£1,140) range, leading consumers to look online for used bikes, fix up their old two-wheelers, or shell out cash for more expensive models.

While buy-in from consumers, urban designers and elected officials may make it seem like a robust trend, some business leaders remain sceptical, wondering if it makes sense to invest in boosted bicycle capacity long term given the economic anomalies of 2020. “It’s unlikely that this demand will keep up,” says Girardi.

Of course, expanding bicycle ridership depends on more than just an expansion of manufacturers or even access to specific bicycle parts. There’s another, overlooked aspect to the bike boom: the concurrent rise of e-cargo bikes, a phenomenon that has the potential to entirely remodel transportation. Known in the logistics industry as light electric freight vehicles (LEFVs), e-cargo bikes have electrical pedal assistance and can be ridden on roads and bicycle lanes, speeding goods and services to their destinations without getting caught in traffic or spewing emissions. In many cities, an LEFV can travel faster than a traditional delivery van because it can be ridden along bicycle bridges and other shortcuts.

For now, good old-fashioned cycling is enjoying a renaissance. Bicycles provide a socially distant way for essential workers and commuters to get around, a healthy alternative to gyms or subways, and a new vision of city streets. “Lockdown meant that suddenly the streets quietened, the air was clean and people felt safe,” says Butler-Adams. “Yes, there was fear of public transport, but mostly it was the joy of experiencing cities as they could be.”

1109,"Driven by steeply falling prices and technological progress that allows batteries to store ever-larger amounts of energy, grid-scale systems are seeing record growth. Many of the gains are spillovers from the auto industry's race to build smaller, cheaper, and more powerful lithium-ion batteries for electric cars. In the US, state clean-energy mandates, along with tax incentives for storage systems that are paired with solar installations, are also playing an important role.

The mass deployment of storage could overcome one of the biggest obstacles to renewable energy – its cycling between oversupply when the sun shines or the wind blows, and shortage when the Sun sets or the wind drops. By smoothing imbalances between supply and demand, proponents say, batteries can replace fossil fuel ""peaker"" plants that kick in for a few hours a day when energy demands soar. As such, widespread energy storage could be key to expanding the reach of renewables and speeding the transition to a carbon-free power grid.

""Energy storage is actually the true bridge to a clean-energy future,"" says Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association.

You might also like:

How quickly that future arrives depends in large part on how rapidly costs continue to fall. Already the price tag for utility-scale battery storage in the US has plummeted, dropping nearly 70% between 2015 and 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. This sharp price drop has followed advances in lithium-ion battery chemistry to significantly improve performance. Battery capacity has expanded too, with facilities able to store and discharge energy over ever-longer periods of time. Market competition and rising battery production also play a major role; a projection by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory sees mid-range costs for lithium-ion batteries falling an additional 45% between 2018 and 2030.

""We're almost entirely piggybacking on the growth of lithium-ion battery technology, which is driven mostly by electric vehicles and consumer electronics,"" says Ray Hohenstein, market applications director for Fluence, an energy storage technology provider with projects totalling nearly 1 gigawatt (1,000 megawatts) set to come online in California within a year. The money put into research for those applications is driving down costs across the board, says Hohenstein. ""It's just like what we saw with solar panels.""

In California, falling battery prices, coupled with the state's aggressive push toward a carbon-free electrical grid by 2045, have led to a packed pipeline of storage projects. A 2013 bill set a target of 1.325 gigawatts of storage to be commissioned for the state's grid by 2020. With 1.5 gigawatts of projects now approved – including more than 500 megawatts installed so far – that goal has already been surpassed, according to the California Public Utilities Commission.",http://www.bbc.com

However, picking seaweed for traditional remedies is an age-old practice along coastal settlements such as Pamban Island and the Gulf of Mannar, a richly biodiverse area.

""My uncle Philip is one of the old generation,"" Ben says. ""He will be retiring soon. I don't think you can win over people. It's more about our generation making an impact.""

Given his knowledge and commitment to reducing climate change, how does Ben respond to critics who argue that we may have to stop eating meat and dairy entirely to make a significant dent in emissions? He pauses. ""I think it's a small minority, who are trying to ruin our future and a business that our family has tried to develop over 100 years. Come to my farm and have a look,"" he says. ""I can show you what we are doing to reduce our emissions footprint, and all the infrastructure we are investing so heavily in.""

When it's time to leave, I ask Hannah if hearing from Peter and Ben has changed her perspective. She harbours dreams of renting her own dairy farm with a small herd and setting up an ice cream business. If she is able to realise her ambitions, would she take steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?

""I suppose you would have to see the figures, but if we could catch the rainwater to wash the milking parlours and got wind turbines and solar panels to supply electricity, it wouldn't affect us farmers,"" she says. ""If there was a way to do our bit and our country did start making steps to improve our emissions, maybe other countries would follow."" But her doubts seem to catch up with her quickly. ""But maybe Philip is right? We don't know who is right and wrong – we don't know the facts.""

Where Hannah remains unsure about dairy farming's climate impact, there is another certainty that she will always come back to: her guiding principle.

""Cows are the most important thing. That's the way I look at it. As long as the cows are happy, we are happy.""

Christmas is different for everyone this year but especially for the thousands of UK families who have lost relatives to Covid-19.

Here, nine people reveal how they plan to remember the loved ones who are no longer here to celebrate the season with them.

My dad, the Welsh gravy king

Dean, Cardiff

""My father was an entrepreneur, raconteur and creative maverick - but he also had a huge heart,"" says neuroscientist and author Dean Burnett.

""He was also pathologically obsessed with gravy.""

Peter Burnett died in April at Morriston Hospital, Swansea. He was 58. In the 1980s and 90s, Dean's parents ran a pub in Pontycymer, in the Garw Valley north of Bridgend.

""My dad was a big community figure and his exploits are still talked about today,"" says Dean. ""It was a bit like growing up in Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights, but with different accents.""

image copyright Dean Burnett image caption Peter and Dean Burnett, and a pan of Dean's gravy

Last Christmas, Dean received a video message from his dad - which was just him delivering festive tidings while stirring a large vat of gravy.

""He always used to practise the gravy beforehand,"" says Dean. ""He'd make it in a big saucepan on the stove, tweaking his secret recipe a little each time.""

This year, Dean's in charge of the gravy. He too has practised in advance.

""I hope I can do my dad proud - and that my wife and children like it!""

I'll toast my action man and his Hawaiian shirts

Gail, Cheshire

""Harry thought of himself as a bit of a Bear Grylls. He was a passionate canoeist and loved being in charge of a good barbecue,"" says Gail, of her late husband.

Harry worked for Manchester University for nearly 40 years, before taking early retirement a year ago. He died in May aged 62.

""My sister in Sydney was always sending him Hawaiian shirts - and the week before he fell ill, he'd posed in a different one each day for Facebook.""

At Harry's funeral, each of Gail's sons wore one of Harry's shirts.

image copyright Gail Pickford image caption Harry (L) and Gail with her three sons

Gail joined a widows' support group, but says it was the couple's seven-year-old dachshund - Daisy - who helped her most through the past few months.

""She saved me through the grief. She's part of him now. She's always looking out, wondering where he is.""

image copyright Gail Pickford image caption Harry with Daisy the dachshund

Gail is spending Christmas with one of her sons - and Daisy of course. A new album filled with photos of Harry - and the Hawaiian shirts - will be open for the family to look through.

""We'll make sure we toast Harry and do our best to remember him.""

Mum's Christmas hamper lives on

Heather, County Down

""Mum came to us every Christmas and I'd make her a hamper of nice things. Her favourite jam, lovely smellies, things that she really liked,"" says Heather, who's a teacher in Belfast.

""A few weeks ago, it struck me that I wouldn't be able to make her a hamper this year.""

Andree died with Covid in hospital in June. She was 92. Heather wanted to carry on the hamper tradition.

image copyright Heather Houston image caption Andree with her daughter Heather

""I suppose because of my grief over Mum, it made me think of the number of elderly people alone,"" she says.

On Facebook, Heather asked friends and family to become a ""Silver Santa"" and provide a personalised present, for about £10, for care home residents.

But her initial post travelled far and wide. ""Within one week I had 800 offers!""

""Because of data protection, we only had the resident's initials, gender and what their favourite things were. One elderly man liked Manchester United and brandy.""

The gifts have been delivered to more than 40 care homes in North Down.

image copyright Heather Houston image caption Heather delivers some of the donated gifts

Andree was always on her sewing machine. When Heather cleared her house after her death, she found hundreds of handicrafts her mum had made over the years.

""I put some of Mum's crafts into a few of the gifts. A little bit of Mum is living on and doing good this Christmas.""

Gifts from my son, so we can remember him

Dorothy, Birmingham

""He was a wonderful son, brother and uncle. He'd buy me lunch and take me shopping. He was always there, always thinking of other people.""

Stephen died at the end of March. He was 39. His family weren't able to bury him until May.

""It was terrible, we were in bits. He was all alone and we couldn't see his body,"" says Dorothy. ""And then one night I had a dream. I was holding him and he told me, 'Mum don't worry, I'm all right.' I felt like I'd said goodbye.""

image copyright Dorothy Gayle image caption Stephen with Dorothy. and his personal items

At Christmas, the family will light 12 candles and say a prayer for Stephen. His brothers and sisters have already each taken one of his personal possessions - ""gifts from him for Christmas"", says Dorothy who has kept a few things for herself.

""A necklace with a lion's head which he had in the hospital - and one of his favourite T-shirts with Bob Marley on the front.""

My mum, the agony aunt

Rhys, Nottinghamshire

""My mum was the agony aunt of Kimberley,"" says Tina's son, Rhys.

Tina had worked for most of her adult life in two supermarkets in the small Nottinghamshire town. She knew everyone.

She died aged 53. Rhys and his brother Anthony were allowed to sit by her bedside, in PPE, until the very end. Their father, Tina's partner Mick, was recovering at home after his own battle with Covid-19.

image copyright Rhys Watkinson image caption Tina Cooke, funeral tributes and enjoying a family meal out

On the day of her funeral, hundreds of people stood outside their homes waving football flags and blowing whistles. Tina was a big supporter of the Rams - Derby County FC. Her football shirt would end up on her seat at Pride Park Stadium for some of the remaining games of the 2019-20 season.

Christmas will be tough says Rhys, but the family are working towards a fitting tribute. Tina will be remembered on an engraved memorial brick at the football ground, with her ashes interred inside.

I'll be on shift, just like my sister would have been

Kazeema, West Midlands

""We got married on the same day to two brothers. I looked after her kids and she looked after mine. She was my heart and soul,"" says Kazeema of her sister Areema.

A newly qualified nurse at the age of 36, Areema died where she worked - at Walsall Manor Hospital. ""She started at the hospital as a housekeeper in 2003,"" says Kazeema. ""Sixteen years later she fulfilled her dream of becoming a nurse.""

image copyright Kazeema Afzal image caption Areema Nasreen with her sisters and at graduation, and Kazeema Afzal (r)

Kazeema is a healthcare assistant in the department where Areema worked. Inspired by her sister, she's now trying to become a nurse herself.

""I want Areema to be proud of me. It's so difficult for some British Asian girls to get into higher education and study. They're expected to bring up families. This is so important.""

The hospital trust has set up a scholarship in Areema's name, which will fully fund a nursing degree for someone who cannot afford the fees. Kazeema says work has kept her sane since Areema died - and over Christmas she'll be on shift.

""Areema would have worked too if she was here,"" she says.

My mum, the angel who always spoke her mind

Joanne, East Lothian

""My mum was a bit of a shopaholic. She used to get taxis to the shops and banter with the drivers,"" says Joanne. ""When she died, I had nice messages from them saying they'd miss her blunt Glaswegian wit. She was funny, but I don't think she always realised it.""

Josie died in April. She was 77. Joanne lived near her mum in Dunbar, to the east of Edinburgh. She and her two daughters have bought a wreath and wicker robin to put on Josie's grave - and a new ornament for their Christmas tree.

image copyright Joanne Ross image caption Josie, Joanne and the angel ornaments and robin

""So we now have angel wings on the tree sitting together. One for Mum - and one for Dad, who died in 2008.""

With money her mum left her, Joanne has bought her daughters a final Christmas gift from their granny - some jewellery.

""Mum was a very bland eater. She always insisted on soup and roast beef for Christmas dinner. It's going to be strange not having her to focus on. We'll all miss her at the table.""

The tree near the sea

Denise, Cornwall

In the corner of a country garden, barely a mile from steep cliffs that overlook the sea, there's a newly planted crab apple tree.

It has already borne a couple of handfuls of bright red fruit and Denise is looking forward to spring - when it will come alive with scented, white blossom. She planted it in memory of her husband John. He always liked fruit trees.

John was 78 and had a long-term, painful medical condition. He was admitted to a hospital ward thought to be Covid-free - but soon developed symptoms. He died in the early hours of a Monday morning. ""That was the longest night of my life,"" says Denise.

The couple moved to their smallholding 20 years ago. For much of that time they reared a flock of sheep. Now though, there are just three animals to look after.

image copyright Denise image caption John and Denise in 2000, their sheep, and the crab apple tree she has planted in his memory

Denise has seen few people in the months since John's death, but she's hoping to see family at Christmas. She likes to sit on a bench close to John's tree.

""We'd like to scatter his ashes around the tree. I want the family to be there and they'd want to be there too. But if it can't be done at Christmas, I'm prepared to wait until spring - when the blossom arrives.""

We pray for my father daily at the cemetery - we'll do the same at Christmas

Ven, West Yorkshire

""Hard-working, that's how I would describe my father,"" says Ven. ""On the day of his burial, we passed through Pontefract Hospital. Some NHS staff and managers were waiting to pay their respects. It was very moving.""

Policarpio, who was originally from the Philippines, died in April aged 67. He was a nurse for more than 40 years before his recent retirement. For the last 18 years of his career he worked for Mid Yorkshire NHS Trust.

image copyright Ven dela Luna image caption Policarpio with his granddaughter and as a younger man

Since Policarpio's funeral in the spring, the family - who are Catholic - have visited the cemetery every day. Over Christmas, they'll do the same.

1174,"Driven by steeply falling prices and technological progress that allows batteries to store ever-larger amounts of energy, grid-scale systems are seeing record growth. Many of the gains are spillovers from the auto industry's race to build smaller, cheaper, and more powerful lithium-ion batteries for electric cars. In the US, state clean-energy mandates, along with tax incentives for storage systems that are paired with solar installations, are also playing an important role.

The mass deployment of storage could overcome one of the biggest obstacles to renewable energy – its cycling between oversupply when the sun shines or the wind blows, and shortage when the Sun sets or the wind drops. By smoothing imbalances between supply and demand, proponents say, batteries can replace fossil fuel ""peaker"" plants that kick in for a few hours a day when energy demands soar. As such, widespread energy storage could be key to expanding the reach of renewables and speeding the transition to a carbon-free power grid.

""Energy storage is actually the true bridge to a clean-energy future,"" says Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association.

You might also like:

How quickly that future arrives depends in large part on how rapidly costs continue to fall. Already the price tag for utility-scale battery storage in the US has plummeted, dropping nearly 70% between 2015 and 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. This sharp price drop has followed advances in lithium-ion battery chemistry to significantly improve performance. Battery capacity has expanded too, with facilities able to store and discharge energy over ever-longer periods of time. Market competition and rising battery production also play a major role; a projection by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory sees mid-range costs for lithium-ion batteries falling an additional 45% between 2018 and 2030.

""We're almost entirely piggybacking on the growth of lithium-ion battery technology, which is driven mostly by electric vehicles and consumer electronics,"" says Ray Hohenstein, market applications director for Fluence, an energy storage technology provider with projects totalling nearly 1 gigawatt (1,000 megawatts) set to come online in California within a year. The money put into research for those applications is driving down costs across the board, says Hohenstein. ""It's just like what we saw with solar panels.""

In California, falling battery prices, coupled with the state's aggressive push toward a carbon-free electrical grid by 2045, have led to a packed pipeline of storage projects. A 2013 bill set a target of 1.325 gigawatts of storage to be commissioned for the state's grid by 2020. With 1.5 gigawatts of projects now approved – including more than 500 megawatts installed so far – that goal has already been surpassed, according to the California Public Utilities Commission.",https://www.bbc.com

But just below the sea’s surface, there is a change taking place which could transform the region's ecosystem, economy and even its cuisine – these coastal villages are the home of India's seaweed boom.

Although seaweed has been used in Indian folk medicine for thousands of years, it has never played as large a part in Indian culture as it has in other Asian countries. However, picking seaweed for traditional remedies is an age-old practice along coastal settlements such as Pamban Island and the Gulf of Mannar, a richly biodiverse area.

""I suppose you would have to see the figures, but if we could catch the rainwater to wash the milking parlours and got wind turbines and solar panels to supply electricity, it wouldn't affect us farmers,"" she says. ""If there was a way to do our bit and our country did start making steps to improve our emissions, maybe other countries would follow."" But her doubts seem to catch up with her quickly. ""But maybe Philip is right? We don't know who is right and wrong – we don't know the facts.""

Where Hannah remains unsure about dairy farming's climate impact, there is another certainty that she will always come back to: her guiding principle.

""Cows are the most important thing. That's the way I look at it. As long as the cows are happy, we are happy.""

1197,"Hawaiian shirts and gravy: Christmas tributes for loved ones lost to Covid Published duration 3 days ago

Christmas is different for everyone this year but especially for the thousands of UK families who have lost relatives to Covid-19.

Here, nine people reveal how they plan to remember the loved ones who are no longer here to celebrate the season with them.

My dad, the Welsh gravy king

Dean, Cardiff

""My father was an entrepreneur, raconteur and creative maverick - but he also had a huge heart,"" says neuroscientist and author Dean Burnett.

""He was also pathologically obsessed with gravy.""

Peter Burnett died in April at Morriston Hospital, Swansea. He was 58. In the 1980s and 90s, Dean's parents ran a pub in Pontycymer, in the Garw Valley north of Bridgend.

""My dad was a big community figure and his exploits are still talked about today,"" says Dean. ""It was a bit like growing up in Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights, but with different accents.""

image copyright Dean Burnett image caption Peter and Dean Burnett, and a pan of Dean's gravy

Last Christmas, Dean received a video message from his dad - which was just him delivering festive tidings while stirring a large vat of gravy.

""He always used to practise the gravy beforehand,"" says Dean. ""He'd make it in a big saucepan on the stove, tweaking his secret recipe a little each time.""

This year, Dean's in charge of the gravy. He too has practised in advance.

""I hope I can do my dad proud - and that my wife and children like it!""

I'll toast my action man and his Hawaiian shirts

Gail, Cheshire

""Harry thought of himself as a bit of a Bear Grylls. He was a passionate canoeist and loved being in charge of a good barbecue,"" says Gail, of her late husband.

Harry worked for Manchester University for nearly 40 years, before taking early retirement a year ago. He died in May aged 62.

""My sister in Sydney was always sending him Hawaiian shirts - and the week before he fell ill, he'd posed in a different one each day for Facebook.""

At Harry's funeral, each of Gail's sons wore one of Harry's shirts.

image copyright Gail Pickford image caption Harry (L) and Gail with her three sons

Gail joined a widows' support group, but says it was the couple's seven-year-old dachshund - Daisy - who helped her most through the past few months.

""She saved me through the grief. She's part of him now. She's always looking out, wondering where he is.""

image copyright Gail Pickford image caption Harry with Daisy the dachshund

Gail is spending Christmas with one of her sons - and Daisy of course. A new album filled with photos of Harry - and the Hawaiian shirts - will be open for the family to look through.

""We'll make sure we toast Harry and do our best to remember him.""

Mum's Christmas hamper lives on

Heather, County Down

""Mum came to us every Christmas and I'd make her a hamper of nice things. Her favourite jam, lovely smellies, things that she really liked,"" says Heather, who's a teacher in Belfast.

""A few weeks ago, it struck me that I wouldn't be able to make her a hamper this year.""

Andree died with Covid in hospital in June. She was 92. Heather wanted to carry on the hamper tradition.

image copyright Heather Houston image caption Andree with her daughter Heather

""I suppose because of my grief over Mum, it made me think of the number of elderly people alone,"" she says.

On Facebook, Heather asked friends and family to become a ""Silver Santa"" and provide a personalised present, for about £10, for care home residents.

But her initial post travelled far and wide. ""Within one week I had 800 offers!""

""Because of data protection, we only had the resident's initials, gender and what their favourite things were. One elderly man liked Manchester United and brandy.""

The gifts have been delivered to more than 40 care homes in North Down.

image copyright Heather Houston image caption Heather delivers some of the donated gifts

Andree was always on her sewing machine. When Heather cleared her house after her death, she found hundreds of handicrafts her mum had made over the years.

""I put some of Mum's crafts into a few of the gifts. A little bit of Mum is living on and doing good this Christmas.""

Gifts from my son, so we can remember him

Dorothy, Birmingham

""He was a wonderful son, brother and uncle. He'd buy me lunch and take me shopping. He was always there, always thinking of other people.""

Stephen died at the end of March. He was 39. His family weren't able to bury him until May.

""It was terrible, we were in bits. He was all alone and we couldn't see his body,"" says Dorothy. ""And then one night I had a dream. I was holding him and he told me, 'Mum don't worry, I'm all right.' I felt like I'd said goodbye.""

image copyright Dorothy Gayle image caption Stephen with Dorothy. and his personal items

At Christmas, the family will light 12 candles and say a prayer for Stephen. His brothers and sisters have already each taken one of his personal possessions - ""gifts from him for Christmas"", says Dorothy who has kept a few things for herself.

""A necklace with a lion's head which he had in the hospital - and one of his favourite T-shirts with Bob Marley on the front.""

My mum, the agony aunt

Rhys, Nottinghamshire

""My mum was the agony aunt of Kimberley,"" says Tina's son, Rhys.

Tina had worked for most of her adult life in two supermarkets in the small Nottinghamshire town. She knew everyone.

She died aged 53. Rhys and his brother Anthony were allowed to sit by her bedside, in PPE, until the very end. Their father, Tina's partner Mick, was recovering at home after his own battle with Covid-19.

On the day of her funeral, hundreds of people stood outside their homes waving football flags and blowing whistles. Tina was a big supporter of the Rams - Derby County FC. Her football shirt would end up on her seat at Pride Park Stadium for some of the remaining games of the 2019-20 season.

Christmas will be tough says Rhys, but the family are working towards a fitting tribute. Tina will be remembered on an engraved memorial brick at the football ground, with her ashes interred inside.

I'll be on shift, just like my sister would have been

Kazeema, West Midlands

""We got married on the same day to two brothers. I looked after her kids and she looked after mine. She was my heart and soul,"" says Kazeema of her sister Areema.

A newly qualified nurse at the age of 36, Areema died where she worked - at Walsall Manor Hospital. ""She started at the hospital as a housekeeper in 2003,"" says Kazeema. ""Sixteen years later she fulfilled her dream of becoming a nurse.""

image copyright Kazeema Afzal image caption Areema Nasreen with her sisters and at graduation, and Kazeema Afzal (r)

Kazeema is a healthcare assistant in the department where Areema worked. Inspired by her sister, she's now trying to become a nurse herself.

""I want Areema to be proud of me. It's so difficult for some British Asian girls to get into higher education and study. They're expected to bring up families. This is so important.""

The hospital trust has set up a scholarship in Areema's name, which will fully fund a nursing degree for someone who cannot afford the fees. Kazeema says work has kept her sane since Areema died - and over Christmas she'll be on shift.

""Areema would have worked too if she was here,"" she says.

My mum, the angel who always spoke her mind

Joanne, East Lothian

""My mum was a bit of a shopaholic. She used to get taxis to the shops and banter with the drivers,"" says Joanne. ""When she died, I had nice messages from them saying they'd miss her blunt Glaswegian wit. She was funny, but I don't think she always realised it.""

Josie died in April. She was 77. Joanne lived near her mum in Dunbar, to the east of Edinburgh. She and her two daughters have bought a wreath and wicker robin to put on Josie's grave - and a new ornament for their Christmas tree.

image copyright Joanne Ross image caption Josie, Joanne and the angel ornaments and robin

""So we now have angel wings on the tree sitting together. One for Mum - and one for Dad, who died in 2008.""

With money her mum left her, Joanne has bought her daughters a final Christmas gift from their granny - some jewellery.

""Mum was a very bland eater. She always insisted on soup and roast beef for Christmas dinner. It's going to be strange not having her to focus on. We'll all miss her at the table.""

The tree near the sea

Denise, Cornwall

In the corner of a country garden, barely a mile from steep cliffs that overlook the sea, there's a newly planted crab apple tree.

It has already borne a couple of handfuls of bright red fruit and Denise is looking forward to spring - when it will come alive with scented, white blossom. She planted it in memory of her husband John. He always liked fruit trees.

John was 78 and had a long-term, painful medical condition. He was admitted to a hospital ward thought to be Covid-free - but soon developed symptoms. He died in the early hours of a Monday morning. ""That was the longest night of my life,"" says Denise.

The couple moved to their smallholding 20 years ago. For much of that time they reared a flock of sheep. Now though, there are just three animals to look after.

image copyright Denise image caption John and Denise in 2000, their sheep, and the crab apple tree she has planted in his memory

Denise has seen few people in the months since John's death, but she's hoping to see family at Christmas. She likes to sit on a bench close to John's tree.

""We'd like to scatter his ashes around the tree. I want the family to be there and they'd want to be there too. But if it can't be done at Christmas, I'm prepared to wait until spring - when the blossom arrives.""

We pray for my father daily at the cemetery - we'll do the same at Christmas

Ven, West Yorkshire

""Hard-working, that's how I would describe my father,"" says Ven. ""On the day of his burial, we passed through Pontefract Hospital. Some NHS staff and managers were waiting to pay their respects. It was very moving.""

Policarpio, who was originally from the Philippines, died in April aged 67. He was a nurse for more than 40 years before his recent retirement. For the last 18 years of his career he worked for Mid Yorkshire NHS Trust.

image copyright Ven dela Luna image caption Policarpio with his granddaughter and as a younger man

Since Policarpio's funeral in the spring, the family - who are Catholic - have visited the cemetery every day. Over Christmas, they'll do the same.

""It's very traditional. In the cemetery we take our rosary beads and recite a special prayer for the deceased - the 'Panalangin para sa mga Yumao'. It helps us think back to better times when my dad was with us. We miss him terribly.""",https://www.bbc.com
